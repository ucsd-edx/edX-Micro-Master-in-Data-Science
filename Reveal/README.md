## Convert Ipython notebooks to Slides using Reveal:
 `toSlides notebook.ipynb`

  This will convert the `notebook.ipynb` to `notebook.slides.html` under the same directory where `notebook.ipynb` is located, and open a new tab in the web browser that displays the Reveal slides.

## Convert Ipython notebooks to Slides and then pdf:
 `Slides2PDF notebook.ipynb`

  This convert the notebook to a Reveal slides file and then convert it to a PDF file. Both of the outputs have the same name as the original notebook, but with different extensions. (.slides.html and .pdf)
