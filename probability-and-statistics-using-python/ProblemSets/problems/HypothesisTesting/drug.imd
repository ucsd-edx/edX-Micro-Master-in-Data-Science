Suppose we are testing 20 drugs and use a significance value of 0.01 in each test. 

Suppose at least one out of the 20 tests rejects the null hypothesis. What is the upper bound for the probability that declaring the corresponding drug useful is a type I error (i.e. reject null hypothesis when one should not)? Notice that the tests may be dependent.
