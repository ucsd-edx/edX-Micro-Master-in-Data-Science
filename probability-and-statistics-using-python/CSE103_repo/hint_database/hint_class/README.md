## Hint Structure

* The hints will only be applied to incorrect student attempts. Each student attempt will only get one hint.

* We have three categories of hints:

  - first universal hints
  - conditional hints
  - last universal hints

  Hints are applied in order. We will first check the first universal hints, if none of the hints is returned, we check conditional hints and last universal hints.

* First Universal Hints

  First universal hints are applied to the following three types of attempts
  - Attempts that are digits instead of expressions
  - Attempts that are fractions instead of integers
  - Attempts that are negative instead of positive

* Conditional Hints

  Conditional hints are written by TAs and tutors that use parse trees and evaluation trees to give adaptive hints to students.

* Last Universal Hints

  Last universal hint will be sent when none of the above hints is returned. The last universal hints is to check whether parts of student's attempt are correct.
