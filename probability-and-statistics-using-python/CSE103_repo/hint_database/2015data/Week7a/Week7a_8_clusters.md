#Problem 8:

      Using the data given in the problem regarding the source of a batch of fish we get the following:
      * The p-value associated with rejecting the HA hypothesis is 0.5616
      * The p value associated with rejecting the HP hypothesis is  0.0677

      Which hypothesis can we reject if we set our confidence level to be [`\alpha=10%`] ?
      (use 1 for reject, 0 for not reject)

      * We can reject the hypothesis that the batch is from the pacific ocean [____]{1}
      * We can reject the hypothesis that the batch is from the atlantic ocean [_____]{0}
