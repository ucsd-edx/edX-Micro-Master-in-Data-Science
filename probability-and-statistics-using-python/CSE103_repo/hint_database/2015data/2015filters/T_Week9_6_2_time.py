  return 'Imagine the question "What is the chance of rolling 3 6\'s on a regular die?". You would probably solve the problem by saying "(1/6)^3" since the chance of rolling a 6 is 1/6 and you\'re doing it 3 times. Now imagine for this problem that the "1/6" is your answer to the first part of this question and the "3" is the total number of times that any hashmap checks a word. Hint: There are k hashmaps that each check n words.'
