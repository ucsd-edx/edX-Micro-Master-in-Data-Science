<p>Like the previous question, suppose you have been dealt "4\(\heartsuit\), 5\(\heartsuit\)".</p><ol><li><p>Suppose you have one opponent. What is the conditional probability that you will win, given these two cards in hand, and that the board is "3\(\diamondsuit\), 4\(\diamondsuit\), 4\(\clubsuit\), 4\(\spadesuit\), 5\(\diamondsuit\)"?</p><ul><li>With this board, we have four of a kind. The only way the opponent will beat it is with a straight flush. How many possible two cards does the opponent have that can make a straight flush, regardless of order? </li></ul></li></ol><p>...(Recall that a straight flush is five cards in sequence of the same suit. This means that Given that there are three sequential diamonds on the table, think about which/how many pairs of diamonds could complete the 3,4,and 5 of diamonds to create such a sequence).  </p><pre><code>[_]- The conditional probability that you will win is the complement of the probability that they will, out of all the remaining cards, have in their hand the necessary cards for a straight flush:[_]</code></pre><ol><li>What if you have two opponents? What is the conditional probability that you will win?</li></ol><p>...(Take into account that opponent A and opponent B could have the straight flush.)</p><pre><code>- The conditional probability that you will win is[_]</code></pre>
