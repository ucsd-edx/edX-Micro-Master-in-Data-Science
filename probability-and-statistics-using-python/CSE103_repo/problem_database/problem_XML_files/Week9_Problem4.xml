<h2>\(\chi^2\) test II</h2>
<p>Suppose that we are counting the number of cars passing a point on the highway during is hour of the day for a year.</p>
<p>We have a hypothsis that the distribution of cars during weekend days is significantly different from the distribution of cars during the working days. How do we test this hypothesis?</p>
<p>We can use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson%27s_chi-squared_test">\(\chi^2\) test</a> tests whether two samples are drawn from the same distribution, or from different distributions. The <strong>null</strong> hypothesis is that the two samples are drawn from the same distribution, and the <strong>alternative</strong> is that they are drawn from different distributions.</p>
<p>To compute the \(\chi^2\)-statistic we need to know the <strong>number of degrees of freedom</strong> of the distribution. As there are \(24\) hours in the day, there are \(24\) probabilities to consider. However, as the probabilities sum to 1, there are only \(23\) degrees of freedom.</p>
<p>The value of the \(\chi^2\)-statistic is non-negative. It is zero if the two samples have the same empirical distribution, and increases the more the distributions differ.</p>
<p>Select all of the statements that are correct:</p>
