```python
# random variables (no need to import random library)


# Solutions with variables converted to string
# Make sure you name the solution with part id at the end. e.g. 'solution1' will be solution for part 1.
solution1 = "4"
solution2 = "1/13"

# Group all solutions into a list
solutions = [solution1, solution2]
