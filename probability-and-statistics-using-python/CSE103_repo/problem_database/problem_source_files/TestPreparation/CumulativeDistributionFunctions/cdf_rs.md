```python
# random variables (no need to import random library)
n = random.randrange(20,25,1)

# Solutions with variables converted to string
# Make sure you name the solution with part id at the end. e.g. 'solution1' will be solution for part 1. 
solution1 = "1+2+3+4+5"
solution2 = "{0}*({1} + 1)/2".format(n, n)

# Group all solutions into a list
solutions = [solution1, solution2]


```



* Let \\\(X\\\) be a discrete random variable with the density function \\\(P(X=x) = x/z\\\), that is defined when \\\(x\ in \\\{1, 2, ... , $n\\\}\\\), and \\\(z\\\) is a normalization constant. Let \\\(F(X)\\\) be the CDF of \\\(X\\\).  What are the values of the following expressions?

o \\\(F(5) = \frac{1}{z}\\times \\\)

[_]

o \\\(F([$n]) =  \frac{1}{z}\\times \\\)

[_]
