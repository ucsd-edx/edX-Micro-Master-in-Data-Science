```python
a = random.randrange(4,6,1)

if (a == 4):
    lts = "AABBCC";
    solution2 = "6!/(2^3)"

if (a == 5):
    lts = "AAABBC";
    solution2 = "6!/(3!*2!)"

if (a == 6):
    lts = "AABCD"
    solution2 = "5!/2"

solution1 = "4!/(2*2)"
solutions = [solution1, solution2]    
```

1. Find the number of distinguishable ways of arranging the letters "MAMA".

[_]

2. Find the number of distinguishable permutations formed by using each of the letters $lts once and only once.
