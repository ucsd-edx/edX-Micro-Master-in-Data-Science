```python
# random variables (no need to import random library)
n = random.randrange(3,6,1)

# Solutions with variables converted to string
# Make sure you name the solution with part id at the end. e.g. 'solution1' will be solution for part 1.
solution1 = "36-(5*5)"
solution2 = "25^{0}".format(n)
solution3 = "26^{0}-25^{0}".format(n)

# Group all solutions into a list
solutions = [solution1, solution2, solution3]

* Roll two fair dice: a red die and a green die.

How many different ways are there of getting at least one six? (take care not to count the outcome (6,6) twice)

* How many strings of $n lower case English letters are there that **do not** contain the letter **"x"**? (order is important and letters can repeat)

[_]

* How many strings of $n lower case English letters are there that contain the letter **"x"** at least once? (as above, order is important and letters can repeat)
