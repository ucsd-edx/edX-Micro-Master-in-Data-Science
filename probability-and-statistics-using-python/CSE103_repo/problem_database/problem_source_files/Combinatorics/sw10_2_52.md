```python
# random variables (no need to import random library)
a = random.randrange(48,55,1)

# Solutions with variables converted to string
# Make sure you name the solution with part id at the end. e.g. 'solution1' will be solution for part 1.
solution1 = "(5*4)/2"
solution2 = "{0}*({0}-1)*({0}-2)*({0}-3)*({0}-4)*({0}-5)/(6*5*4*3*2)".format(a)

# Group all solutions into a list
solutions = [solution1, solution2]

```

* You choose two **different** numbers between 1 and 5. How many
  different choices are there if the order of the numbers is **not**
  important (i.e. we consider only the **set** of numbers) ?

* In the "6/$a" lottery game, a player picks six numbers between 1 to $a.


How many different choices does the player have if repetition is not allowed

**and** the order of the numbers is not important.
