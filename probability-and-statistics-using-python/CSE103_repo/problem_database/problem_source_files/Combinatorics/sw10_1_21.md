```python
# random variables (no need to import random library)
a = random.randrange(2,3,1)
b = random.randrange(2,3,1)
c = 7-a-b

# Solutions with variables converted to string
# Make sure you name the solution with part id at the end. e.g. 'solution1' will be solution for part 1.
solution1 = "10*26"
solution2 = "10^{0}*26^{1}*10^(7-{0}-{1})".format(a,b)

# Group all solutions into a list
solutions = [solution1, solution2]

* Suppose automobile license plates in an imaginary country consist of $a numbers,followed by $b letters, followed by $c numbers.

How many different standard plates are possible in this system? (Assume repetition of letters and numbers is allowed.)
