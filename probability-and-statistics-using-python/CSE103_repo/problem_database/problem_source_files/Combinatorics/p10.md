```python
# random variables (no need to import random library)
a = random.randrange(10,14,1)
n = random.randrange(2,5,1)

# Solutions with variables converted to string
# Make sure you name the solution with part id at the end. e.g. 'solution1' will be solution for part 1.
solution1 = "3*2"
solution2 = "{0}*2*{1}".format(a,n)

# Group all solutions into a list
solutions = [solution1, solution2]
