```python
# random variables (no need to import random library)

# Solutions with variables converted to string
# Make sure you name the solution with part id at the end. e.g. 'solution1' will be solution for part 1.

variables = ["cumulative_uniform_masses_5.png", "2.0", "0.05", "10.0",
 "0.01", "1.0", "0.4", "7.0", "0.3", "12.0", "0.11"]

* What are the uniform densities and mass distributions that could have been summed to produce this CDF?

Uniform distributions:

- Uniform on (0.10, X) of probability density Y.

X =

- Point mass at

[_]

with probability

[_]

- Point mass at

[_]

with probability
