```python
# random variables (no need to import random library)
n = random.randrange(3,6,1)
k = random.randrange(1,6,2)

# Solutions with variables converted to string
# Make sure you name the solution with part id at the end. e.g. 'solution1' will be solution for part 1. 
solution1 = "(26^{0})-(25^{0})+{1}".format(n,k)
solution2 = "8"
solution3 = "35*{0}".format(k)

# Group all solutions into a list
solutions = [solution1, solution2, solution3]


```
