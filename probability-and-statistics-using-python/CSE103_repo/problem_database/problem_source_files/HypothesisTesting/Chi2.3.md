```python
# random variables (no need to import random library)

# Solutions with variables converted to string
# Make sure you name the solution with part id at the end. e.g. 'solution1' will be solution for part 1.
solution1 = "1"
solution2 = "0"


# Group all solutions into a list
solutions = [solution1, solution2]


```

Using the data given in the problem regarding the source of a batch of fish we get the following:

* The p-value associated with rejecting the HA hypothesis is 0.5616
* The p-value associated with rejecting the HP hypothesis is  0.0677

Which hypothesis can we reject if we set our confidence level to be \\\(\alpha=\\\)10% ?
(use 1 for reject, 0 for not reject)

* We can reject the hypothesis that the batch is from the Pacific ocean

[_]

* We can reject the hypothesis that the batch is from the Atlantic ocean

[_]
