```python
# random variables (no need to import random library)


# Solutions with variables converted to string
# Make sure you name the solution with part id at the end. e.g. 'solution1' will be solution for part 1.
solution1 = "0.05/sqrt(0.16/200)"
solution2 = "Q(0.05/sqrt(0.16/200))"
solution3 = "1"

A noted psychic was tested for extrasensory perception. The psychic was presented
with 200 cards face down and asked to determine if the card were one of five symbols.
The psychic was correct in 50 cases. Let p represent the probability that the psychic
correctly identifies the symbol on the card in a random trial. Assume the 200 trials
can be treated as a simple random sample.

Suppose you wished to see if there were evidence that the psychic is
doing better than just guessing. To do this, you test the hypotheses \\\(H_0 : p = .20\\\)
 versus
\\\(H_{alternative} : p > .20\\\).

* Can you reject at the .05 significance level? (answer 1 for yes or 0 for no)
