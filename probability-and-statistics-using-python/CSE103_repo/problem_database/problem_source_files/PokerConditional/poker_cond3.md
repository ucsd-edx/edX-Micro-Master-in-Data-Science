```python
# random variables (no need to import random library)

# Solutions with variables converted to string
# Make sure you name the solution with part id at the end. e.g. 'solution1' will be solution for part 1.
solution1 = "3"
solution2 = "1-3/C(52-7,2)"
solution3 = "(1-3/C(52-7,2))*(1-3/C(52-9,2))"


# Group all solutions into a list
solutions = [solution1, solution2, solution3]


```



Like the previous question, suppose you have been dealt "4\\\(\\heartsuit\\\), 5\\\(\\heartsuit\\\)".

1. Suppose you have one opponent. What is the conditional probability that you will win, given these two cards in hand, and that the board is "3\\\(\\diamondsuit\\\), 4\\\(\\diamondsuit\\\), 4\\\(\\clubsuit\\\), 4\\\(\\spadesuit\\\), 5\\\(\\diamondsuit\\\)"?

    - With this board, we have four of a kind. The only way the opponent will beat it is with a straight flush. How many possible two cards does the opponent have that can make a straight flush, regardless of order.?

    [_]

    - The conditional probability that you will win is

    [_]

2. What if you have two opponents? What is the conditional probability that you will win?

    - The conditional probability that you will win is

    [_]
