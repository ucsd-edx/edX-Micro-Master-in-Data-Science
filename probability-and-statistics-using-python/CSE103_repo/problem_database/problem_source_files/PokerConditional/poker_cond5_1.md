# Solutions with variables converted to string
# Make sure you name the solution with part id at the end. e.g. 'solution1' will be solution for part 1.
solution1 = "C(32,5) - C(20,5)"
solution2 = "C(52,5) - C(40,5)"

* Find the probability that a poker hand of 5 cards from a standard deck will contain no card smaller than 7 (i.e. 2,3...6) (call this event \\\(A\\\)), given that it contains at least one face card (i.e. J, Q, K) (call this event \\\(B\\\))
We define two events:

* Event \\\(A\\\): The hand contains no card smaller than 7.

* Event \\\(B\\\): The hand contains at least one face card.

We first compute the size of the relevant events \\\(|A \\cap B| = \\\)

[_]

\\\(|B| = \\\)

[_]

We then use the ratio between the sizes of the events to find the conditional probability:

- The conditional probability \\\(P(A|B) = \\\)
