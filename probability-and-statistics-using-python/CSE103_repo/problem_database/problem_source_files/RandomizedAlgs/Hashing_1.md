```python
# random variables (no need to import random library)
#import math
#def pnk(n, k):
#   return math.factorial(26) / math.factorial(26 - a)

a=random.randrange(2,3,1)
showHint = 3;

# Solutions with variables converted to string
# Make sure you name the solution with part id at the end. e.g. 'solution1' will be solution for part 1. 
solution1 = "P(26, {0})".format(a)




# Group all solutions into a list
solutions = [solution1]


```
