## Probability of Poker Hands ##
You are given a deck of cards with *$ns suits* and *$nr ranks*, compute the probability of "two pairs".

[_]

The number of possibilities for the ranks of the two pairs is

[_]

The number of possibilities for the rank of the single, (after the ranks of the pairs have been chosen) is

[_]

The number of possibilities for the suits of the two pairs is

[_]

The number of possibilities for the suit of the single is

[_]

Thus the number of hands with exactly two pairs is

[_]

The ratio of this number to the number of all hands

[_]
