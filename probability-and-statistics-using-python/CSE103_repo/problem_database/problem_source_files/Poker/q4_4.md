### Straight ###

* You are given a deck of cards with $ns suits and $nr ranks, compute the probability of a "Straight", which is five cards in sequence, but not all from the same suit.

The number of all possible hands is

[_]

* In the case of a standard deck, the ranks of a straight is one of (Ace,2,3,4,5) ... (10,J,Q,K,Ace). Similarly, in your deck, the number of possibilities for the ranks of a strai

[_]

* The suits can be anything other than all equal, so the number of possibilities for the suits of a straight is

[_]

* Thus the number of hands that is a straight is

[_]

* The ratio of this number to the number of all hands

[_]
