1. 
For two sets, the inclusion-exclusion principle says that 
|A\union B|=|A|+|B|-|A\inter B|
(may need to use \cap or \bigcap, \cup, \bigcup)

Given two sets $A$ and B$G, calculate their union in two ways.

a. First determine $A\union B$, and then the size of this union. 

Input: Two sets A and B

Output 1: The set AUB

Output 2: |AUB| = 

b. First deterimine $|A|$, $|B|$, $A\inter B$, and $|A\inter B|4.
Then use the inclusion exclusion formula to determin $|A\union B$. 

Input: Two sets A and B.

Output 1: |A|=
Output 2: |B|=
Output 3: |A\inter B|=
Output 4: |A\union B|=

2. For three sets, the inclusion-exclusion principle says that 
|A\union B|=|A|+|B|-|A\inter B|....

Given three sets $A$, $B$, and $C$, determine... in two ways.

a. First determine the union $A\union B\union C$, then its size
$|A..|$. 

Output 1: A Union

Output 2: size

b. First detemrine the sizes of the three sets and all their
mutual intersections. Then determine |A\union...|. 
Note that for brevity we are asking you to print the intermeiate
answer just for $A\inter B\inter C$, but you need to calculate
all. 

Output 1: A\inter B\inter C
Output 2: |....|
Output 3: |A\union...|
