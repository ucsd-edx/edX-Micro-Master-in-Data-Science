In the binomial distribution, there are $n$
Bernoulli variables $X_1,...,X_n$ where each
$X_i\sim B(p)$ for the same success probability $p$,
and $X=\sum_{i=1}^n X_i$. We have seen that 
P(X=k)=\binom nk \cdot p^k\cdot \overline p^{n-k}.

In the Poisson-binomial distribution, again there
are $n$ independent Bernoulli variables (sometimes called
\emph{Poisson trials}), and again and $X=\sum_{i=1}^n X_i$.
However, now each $X_i\sim B(p_i)$ where the $p_i$'s may differ. 
Now $P(X=k)$ does not have a simple formula, but it can be 
computed numerically. 

One way to do it is to determine all $k$-subsets of 
$\{1,...,n\}$, for each such subset S determine the
probability that $X_i$ is 1 iff $i\in S$, and 
then sum the probabilities. 

For example

P={0.4, 0.3, 0.8}

k=2

List all 2-subsets of {1,..,3} and the probabilty
that $X_i$ is one iff i is in the subset
1,2 0.4*0.3*0.2 (just print answer)
1,3
2,3

P(X=k): [sum of all of these probabilities]
