The great limnologist George Evelyn
Hutchinson famously asked the
question, "why are there so many
kinds of animals?"1
. Hutchinson's answer
to his own question has become one
of the foundational ideas in ecology, and
has to do with the abundance of 'regulating
factors' in the environment. However,
the idea’s deceptive simplicity can lead
to important misinterpretations, as
reported by Ashby et al2
 in Nature Ecology
& Evolution.
Building on a classical theoretical
model in which species possess a suite
of traits and the degree of competition
between them is governed by trait
similarity, they show that the way
competition should vary with trait distance
depends sensitively on whether the
different traits introduce new ways of being
regulated. If not — and the authors argue
that this case is typical — then the number
of trait combinations that can coexist is
much smaller than the full set of
available permutations, leaving many
potential ecological possibilities
unfilled.
Every species is a mind-bogglingly
complex solution to a unique evolutionary
problem. But the confusing fact that there
are more than eight million eukaryotic
species alone3
 reveals an apparent
contradiction in our ideas about how
such diversity could arise in the first
place. For if take it for granted that
inferior types are discarded via natural
selection, then why are there multiple
species to begin with, instead of just
the 'best' one?
