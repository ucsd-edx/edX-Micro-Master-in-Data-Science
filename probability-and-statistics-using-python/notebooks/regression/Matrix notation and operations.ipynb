If this term is very close to zero, an inverse may exist but $A^{-1}$ may be poorly conditioned meaning it is prone to rounding error and is likely not well identified computationally.  The term $a_{11}a_{22}-a_{12}a_{21}$ is the determinant of matrix A, and for square matrices of size greater than $2 \\times 2$, if equal to zero indicates that you have a problem with your data matrix (columns are linearly dependent on other columns).
