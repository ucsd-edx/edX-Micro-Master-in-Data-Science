Which of the following is true for every random variables \(X\) and \(Y\)?

[x] \(E[X+Y]=E[X]+E[Y]\)
[ ] \(E[XY]=E[X]E[Y]\)
[ ] \(V(X+Y)=V(X)+V(Y)\)
[x] If \(X\) and \(Y\) are independent, \(E[XY]=E[X]E[Y]\).
[ ] If \(E[XY]=E[X]E[Y]\), then \(X\) and \(Y\) are independent.
[x] If \(X\) and \(Y\) are independent, \(V(X+Y)=V(X)+V(Y)\).
[x] If \(X\) and \(Y\) are uncorrelated, \(V(X+Y)=V(X)+V(Y)\).
