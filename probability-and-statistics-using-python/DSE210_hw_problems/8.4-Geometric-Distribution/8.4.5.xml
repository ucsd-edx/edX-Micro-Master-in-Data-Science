<p>A basketball player is doing a shooting workout, in which he will keeping shooting until he first makes 10 under the basket, then makes 10 at the free-throw line, lastly makes 5 at the 3-point line. If the probabilities that he makes a shot under the basket, at the free throw line and at the 3-point line are 0.9, 0.7 and 0.5, denote the number of shots he takes as \(X\), calculate the following:</p>

<ul><li>\(P(X=27)\)</li></ul>
<numericalresponse answer="0.00684834">
<responseparam type="tolerance" default="0.001"/>
  <formulaequationinput />
</numericalresponse>
  
<ul><li>\(E[X]\)</li></ul>
  <numericalresponse answer="100/9+100/7+10">
<responseparam type="tolerance" default="0.001"/>
  <formulaequationinput />
</numericalresponse>
  
<ul><li>\(V(X)\)</li></ul>
  <numericalresponse answer="10*0.1/0.9^2+10*0.3/0.7^2+5*0.5/0.5^2">
<responseparam type="tolerance" default="0.001"/>
  <formulaequationinput />
