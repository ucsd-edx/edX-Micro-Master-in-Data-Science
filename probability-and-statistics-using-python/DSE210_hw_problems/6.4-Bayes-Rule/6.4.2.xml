<problem>
<p>A particular car manufacturer has three factories \(F_1\), \(F_2\), \(F_3\) making 21%, 35%, and 44%, respectively, of its cars. Of their output, 7%, 6%, and 2%, respectively, are defective. A car is chosen at random from the manufacturerâ€™s supply.</p>

<ul><li>What is the probability that the car is defective?</li></ul>
