<p>Assume in blackjack aces always worth 11 and all face cards (jack, queen, king) worth 10. Given a shuffled deck of 52 cards:</p>

<ul><li>What is the probability that you draw 2 cards and they sum 21?</li></ul>
<numericalresponse answer="0.0483">
<responseparam type="tolerance" default="0.001"/>
  <formulaequationinput />
</numericalresponse>

<ul><li>What is the probability that you draw 2 cards and they sum 10?</li></ul>
<numericalresponse answer="0.0407">
<responseparam type="tolerance" default="0.001"/>
  <formulaequationinput />
</numericalresponse>

<ul><li>If you have drawn the 10 of clubs and 4 of hearts, and there are 50 cards left in the deck, what is the probability that the sum exceeds 21 when the third card is drawn?</li></ul>
