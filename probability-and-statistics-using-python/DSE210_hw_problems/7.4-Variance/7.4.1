Which of the following are always true for random variables \(X\), \(Y\) and real number \(a\), \(b\)?

[x] The variance of \(X\) is always non-negative.
[x] The standard deviation of \(X\) is always non-negative.
[x] If \(V(X)=V(Y)\), then \(V(X+a)=V(Y+b)\).
[ ] If \(V(aX)=V(bX)\) for \(a\not=0\) and \(b\not=0\), then \(a=b\).
[ ] If \(E[X]=E[Y]\) and \(V(X)=V(Y)\), then \(X=Y\).
[x] If \(E[X]=E[Y]\) and \(V(X)=V(Y)\), then \(E[X^2]=E[Y^2]\).
