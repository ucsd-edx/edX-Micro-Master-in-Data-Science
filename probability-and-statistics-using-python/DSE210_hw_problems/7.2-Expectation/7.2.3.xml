      <div class="detailed-solution">
        <p>Explanation</p>
        <p>Let y = amount player loose on no heads. Let X = net gain after two coins flip. \(E[X]\)= 3*.25 + 1*.5 - y *.25. For game to be fair, E[X] = 0. Solving for y we get y=5. Therefore, player loose 5$ if no heads occur for the game to be fair.</p>
