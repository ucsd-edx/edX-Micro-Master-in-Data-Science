A derangement is a permutation of the elements such that none appear in its original position. For example, \(\{1,2,3\}\) has 2 derangements: \(\{2,3,1\}\) and \(\{3,1,2\}\).
How many derangements does \(\{1,2,3,4\}\) have?
Hint: use the inclusion-exclusion principle.

= 10

[explanation]
In general the number of distinct derangements on \(n\) elements is called the subfactorial \(!n\).
