A derangement is a permutation of the elements such that none appear in its original position. For example, the only derangements of \(\{1,2,3\}\) are \(\{2,3,1\}\) and \(\{3,1,2\}\). How many derangements does \(\{1,2,3,4\}\) have? 
(hint: inclusion-exclusion principle)

= 10

[explanation]
In general the number of distinct derangements on \(n\) elements is called the subfactorial \(!n\).
