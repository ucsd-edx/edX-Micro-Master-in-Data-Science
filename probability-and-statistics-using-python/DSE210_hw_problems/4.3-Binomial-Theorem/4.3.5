A game uses a deck of \(n\) different cards, where \(n\) is an integer and \(n \geq 6\). The number of possible sets of 6 cards that can be drawn from the deck is 6 times the number of possible sets of 3 cards that can be drawn. Find \(n\).


How many cards are in a deck of at least 6 cards if the number of 6-card hands is six times larger than the number of 3-cards hands. 

= 13
