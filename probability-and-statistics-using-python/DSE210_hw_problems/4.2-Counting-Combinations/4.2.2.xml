<numericalresponse answer="126">
  <p>A rectangle in an \(m\times n\) chessboard, is a cartesian product \(S\times T\), where \(S\) is an interval in \(\{1,...,m\}\) and \(T\) is an interval in \(\{1,2,...,n\}\). For example, here are two rectangles in the \(4\times 5\) chessboard. Observe that the \(2\times2\) chessboard has 9 rectangles. How many rectangles does the \(3\times 6\) chessboard have? </p>
