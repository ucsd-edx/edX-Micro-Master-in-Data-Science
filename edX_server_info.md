# edX servers

All instructors should have access to the following servers

### 1. Official edX Server
This is the server in which the micro-masters will be run.

* Studio URL: [https://studio.edx.org/home/](https://studio.edx.org/home/)


### 2. Edge edX Server
This server is run on edX machines but is intended to be used for internal courses in a university.
* Course URL: [https://edge.edx.org/dashboard](https://edge.edx.org/dashboard)
* Studio URL: [https://studio.edge.edx.org/home/](https://studio.edge.edx.org/home/)


### 3. CSE Local edX Server
This server resides in room 4223. Currently it hosts an older version of edX so it is not appropriate for actual courses. However, it can still be used for debugging problem sets.

* Studio URL: [http://edx.cse.ucsd.edu:18010/home/](http://edx.cse.ucsd.edu:18010/home/)
