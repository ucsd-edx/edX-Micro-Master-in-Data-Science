    "1. Find Cartesian product of the RDD with itself, so that you get a set of a pair of distinct point co-ordinates. For instance, if your RDD is {(1,0), (2,0), (3,0)}, the function should return {((1,0), (2,0)), ((2,0), (1,0)), ((1,0), (3,0)), ((3,0), (1,0)), ((2,0), (3,0)), ((3,0), (2,0))}\n",
    "2. Find the slope between pairs of all points. If more than one pair have the same slope and one of the points is common, it means that the three points are collinear. For instance, let's take the result from the previous step as {((1,0), (2,0)), ((2,0), (1,0)), ((1,0), (3,0)), ((3,0), (1,0)), ((2,0), (3,0)), ((3,0), (2,0))}. Slope between (1,0) and (2,0) is 0, and slope between (1,0) and (3,0) is 0. Since (1,0) is common to both of them, they must all be collinear.\n"
