    "In this programming assignment, your task is to classify geographical locations according to their predicted tree cover using Gradient Boosting and Random Forest classifiers. You are expected to fill in functions that would complete this task. All of the necessary helper code is included in this notebook. However, we advise you to go over the lecture material, the EdX videos and the corresponding notebooks before you attempt this Programming Assignment. You can find information about the dataset to be used in the following links:\n",

    "      * **loss** – Loss function used for minimization during gradient boosting. Supported: {“logLoss” (default), “leastSquaresError”, “leastAbsoluteError”}.\n",
    "      * **numIterations** – Number of iterations of boosting. (default: 100)\n",
    "      * **learningRate** – Learning rate for shrinking the contribution of each estimator. The learning rate should be between in the interval (0, 1]. (default: 0.1)\n",
    "      * **maxDepth** – Maximum depth of the tree. E.g., depth 0 means 1 leaf node; depth 1 means 1 internal node + 2 leaf nodes. (default: 3)\n",

    "   * `load(sc,path)` : The counterpart to save - load classifier from file.\n",

    "* *numClasses* – number of classes for classification.  \n",

    "* *featureSubsetStrategy* – Number of features to consider for splits at each node. Supported: “auto” (default), “all”, “sqrt”, “log2”, “onethird”. If “auto” is set, this parameter is set based on numTrees: if numTrees == 1, set to “all”; if numTrees > 1 (forest) set to “sqrt”.\n",
    "* *impurity* – Criterion used for information gain calculation. Supported values: “gini” (recommended) or “entropy”.  \n",
