    "In this programming assignment, your task is to classify geographical locations according to their predicted tree cover using Gradient Boosting and Random Forest classifiers. You are expected to fill in functions that would complete this task. All of the necessary helper code is included in this notebook. However, we advise you to go over the lecture material, the EdX videos and the corresponding notebooks before you attempt this Programming Assignment. You can find information about the dataset to be used in the following links:\n",

    "* *data* – Training dataset: RDD of LabeledPoint. Labels should take values {0, 1, ..., numClasses-1}.  \n",
    "* *numClasses* – number of classes for classification.  \n",

    "* *numTrees* – Number of trees in the random forest.  \n",
    "* *featureSubsetStrategy* – Number of features to consider for splits at each node. Supported: “auto” (default), “all”, “sqrt”, “log2”, “onethird”. If “auto” is set, this parameter is set based on numTrees: if numTrees == 1, set to “all”; if numTrees > 1 (forest) set to “sqrt”.\n",
    "* *impurity* – Criterion used for information gain calculation. Supported values: “gini” (recommended) or “entropy”.  \n",
    "* *maxDepth* – Maximum depth of the tree. E.g., depth 0 means 1 leaf node; depth 1 means 1 internal node + 2 leaf nodes. (default: 4)  \n",
    "* *maxBins* – maximum number of bins used for splitting features (default: 32)\n",
    "* *seed* – Random seed for bootstrapping and choosing feature subsets.  \n",
