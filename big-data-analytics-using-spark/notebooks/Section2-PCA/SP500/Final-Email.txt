Dear XXXXXX,

The take home final has been posted. You can get it by pulling the
class repository. The files are in the directory

https://github.com/ucsd-edx/CSE255-DSE230/tree/master/Classes/Final

The exam consists of three notebooks:

1.Prepare daily ratio file to be read as spark Dataframe.ipynb
2.PCA of stocks using Spark.ipynb
3.Dimensionality.ipynb

You should work on these notebooks in order because they depend on
each other.

The data files are stored separately on S3. Directions for downloading
the files are in the first notebook.

To make each exam slightly different, we ask that you remove the
following stocks (ticker symbols) before you perform your analysis.

XX,YYY,.....

Remember, even though this is a take-home exam, it is still an
exam. We trust your honesty that you will do your own work and not
help or be helped by others, whether in the class or elsewhere. You
are allowed to use any material you find on the web, but you cannot be
helped by other people.

Penalty for breaking this honor code will be severe.

Clarification questions can be asked in class or posted on Piazza.

The completed exam should be submitted to pyBolt. The deadline for
submission is midnight between Wed 6/14 and Thu 6/15

Good luck.

Prof. Freund
