# Big Data Analytics Using Spark

## Installing:
 1. cd Reveal
 2. `source setup.sh`

## Convert Ipython notebooks to Slides using Reveal:
 `toSlides notebook.ipynb`
  This will convert the `notebook.ipynb` to `notebook.slides.html` under the same directory where `notebook.ipynb` is located, and open a new tab in the web browser that displays the Reveal slides.

## Convert Ipython notebooks to Slides and then pdf:
 `Slides2PDF notebook.ipynb`
  This does the same job as toSlides, and in addition, it opens another page where the slides are concatenated as a single page, which you can print and save as pdf.

 example output: `notebooks/BasicSpark/1. Spark Basics.pdf`
