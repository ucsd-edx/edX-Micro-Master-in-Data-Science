Submission 2 doesn't have this kind of problem. Although the structure of the sample report can be used, but common conclusion in similar words should  be avoided. On the other hand, Submission 2 showed some result beyond just the code in the given notebooks, such as the figure of map which visualized PCA coefficient in triangles as professor mentioned in class.

On the other hand, Submission 1 seems just paste the station p-value figure to the report without careful  analysis and thus no profound conclusion.

It first shows the check of whole data set, then analyzed SNWD, TBOS and PRCP measurements respectively, in the section of each measurement, it introduce different aspect of the data. If the data has high variance in top eigen-vectors, Submission 2 then implemented the PCA method. For those measurement with low variance, like PRCP, Submission 2 also tried to analyze them in other aspect, like monthly precipitation analysis. I notice although analyzing different aspect, Submission can show them in a clear way for readers. However, Submission 1 confused reader with unclear organization. For example, it mixed graphical distribution of coefficient with hypothesis test part in an unclear way.</td>
