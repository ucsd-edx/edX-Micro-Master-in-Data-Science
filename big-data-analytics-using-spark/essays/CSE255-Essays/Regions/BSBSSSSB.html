However, as mentioned before, Submission 2 implemented more analysis tools, thus, it results in more convincing results. One significant example is the conclusion in Submission 2, which claims "correlation of whether rain or not in some locations", resulting from the hypothesis test part.</td>
      <td><p style='color:red'>Worse</p>In submission 1, I notice that it suddenly jumped to the PRCP analysis from the SNWD analysis, with fragmentary conclusion of the previous part. On the other hand, Submission 2 organized much better. from data check to Variance analysis, following with the PCA analysis and hypothesis test, respectively.</td>
