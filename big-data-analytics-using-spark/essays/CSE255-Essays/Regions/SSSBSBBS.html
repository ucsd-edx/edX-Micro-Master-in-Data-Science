However submission 1 decided to show percentage of variance per measurement with one figure per page, which makes it harder to compare one another.</td>

Submission 2 has typos such as "coeff2" is used under coeff3 analysis, "dependency" is typed as "rependency". Its conclusions were drawn without indicating which figure it is drawn from as discussed previously. The PRCP matrix is not shown, and the conclusion from that figure that indicates the station names do not seem to add much to the report without plotting the locations of these stations. I think the report would have been more clean without these excessive information.</td>

Submission1 is better in this regard since there is a good analyzing residues part which explains why PCA is not good for PRCP. Also submission 2 fails to show list of highly correlated states.</td>
