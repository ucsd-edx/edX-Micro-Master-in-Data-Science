Submission 1 report does try out various statistical tools inlcuding Univariate analysis, PCA Analysis, Moving Epoch and Cholesky decomposition.
While Submission 2 report focuses on basic graphs and maps to convey the findings.</p><p>1. Misses on a lot of analysis
2. Cover the statistics with good rigor</p><h6>signif</h6><p>Submission one shows stronger support with in-depth analysis to support conclusions</p><p>Both submissions had a good support for their Conclusions.</p><p>In submission 2, the map figures in the last section are not well explained and analyzed.</p><p>Both have discussed different topics with their relevant details</p><p>Submission 1 has better statistical analysis.</p><p>Submission report 1 gets into the depth of historical analysis and gives a clear picture of what each graph and map depicting the data conveys.
Submission report 2 does use a lot of different analyzing tricks, but fails to draw substantial conclusions from it.</p><p>1. Could've done more analysis. Looks incomplete.
2. Covered most parts of the base analysis well with strong statistical reasonings.</p><h6>orig</h6><p>Instead of simply following the codes provided, the author took a step further to zoom in on TOBS coefficients and plotted it in boxplot for better visualization. The story-telling in this report is relatively more complete and logical.</p><p>Though submission 1 was not as rigorous as submission 2, I feel that more work was done in submission 1 without referring to the instructor's notebooks. Submission 2 went beyond it too but submission 1 was just better in this case.</p><p>In submission 1, several maps and error bars are introduced in the analysis of temperature.</p><p>Discusses heatmap.</p><p>Both submission reports 1 & 2 go further beyond the analysis provided by instructor.
While Submission 1 report finds meaningful conclusion using historical data with different graphs and maps, Submission 2 report uses some new tools and code to try and find some conclusions  from the data.</p><p>1. Good original work added
2. Covers all the work from the notebooks </p><h6>present</h6><p>The author provided good visuals of the analysis and the organization of the entire report is tight and logical.The layout is very well organized and the key points are well highlighted.</p><p>Definitely submission 1. Submission 2 had more content but it wasn't as well organized as submission 1.</p><p>In submission 2, some figures in the last section are not well rendered. Also no conclusion is presented with analysis.</p><p>Equally good overrview presentation.</p><p>Although submission 2 is much longer, but there are too much redundancy and white space. The layout of submission 1 is better. </p><p>Submission report 1 has used clear tables and well structured maps to convey the results of analysis. The whole document structure is better well presented in comparison to Submission report 2.</p><p>1. Good Presentation
2. Flow is good and similar to the sample notebook</p><h6 style='color:red'>Student is submission 2</h6><h6>rigor</h6><h6>signif</h6><h6>orig</h6><h6>present</h6><hr><h1>A53205632</h1><h3>Rank: 3&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Score:  0.7</h3><h6 style='color:red'>Student is submission 1</h6><h6>rigor</h6><p>They use almost same amounts and types of models.</p><p>submission1 substantial figures to illustrate data from different views</p><p>Both use various tools to analyze; submission 1 analyze more about the data</p><p>Both reports are missing good statistical study other than what is being provided.</p><h6>signif</h6><p>The analysis in Sub1 is more quantitative.</p><p>Both conclusions are well supported by the data; submission 1 have a strong support</p><p>Both reports didn't provide strong statistical support.</p><h6>orig</h6><p>Both go beyond the provided analysis; submission 1 go far more beyond the analysis.</p><p>Submission 1 tried to bringin originality by exploring in tableau. Submission 2 tried explaining other aspects in analysis in a newer way. So both have convincing points in terms of originality.</p><h6>present</h6><p>Sub1 has several images failure while Sub2 has not.</p><p>Both a good presentation; submission 1 really impresses me.</p><p>Story is well told with plots and summary/conclusion in both the cases.</p><h6 style='color:red'>Student is submission 2</h6><h6>rigor</h6><p>1. Didn't try any different hypothesis for the analysis so the tools used were very limited.
2. Good statictical tools used for the analysis. Relevant to the data/problem at hand.</p><p>Tableau looks impressive</p><p>Correlation and covariance analysis was included in submission 1</p><p>Use of scatter plots for correlations and heatmap use is very well done.</p><h6>signif</h6><p>1. Analysed one measurement but not in depth so not much support in my opinion.
2. The explanation and analysis for proposed hypothesis were relevant.</p><p>Rain have spatial relationship</p><p>More statistical analysis is done in report 1</p><p>Wider range of analysis done with good explanation as compared to Submission 2.</p><h6>orig</h6><p>1. No originality as such. Mostly similar analysis done in sample notebook.
2. Concrete original analysis included. Particularly, Tableau maps and elevation/year plots.</p><p>Tableau , Heatmap</p><p>Submission 2 does not have covariance analysis</p><p>Different analysis as compared to the notebooks is noteworthy.</p><h6>present</h6><p>1. Ok presentation. Similar to the one in sample report so not much innovation.
2. Good Presentation. The flow was intuitive.</p><p>More figures , analyzing the data</p><p>Similar between two submission</p><p>Clear, precise, very well explained analysis.</p><hr><h1>A53221997</h1><h3>Rank: 4&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Score:  -1.0</h3><h6 style='color:red'>Student is submission 1</h6><h6>rigor</h6><h6>signif</h6><h6>orig</h6><h6>present</h6><h6 style='color:red'>Student is submission 2</h6><h6>rigor</h6><p>1.  Used World climate and US Climate official site to gather information for Sanity check. 
2.  Analysis included correlation and Residuals for construction graphs but no description.</p><p>Basically every tool talked in class is covered and well analyzed in submission 2(Although most of the figures are dead. Need to dig into the figures folders). While in submission 1, some figures are not well explained.</p><p>Report 2 uses one extra utility, ipyleaflet as compared to report 1, which does not use it for any spatial analysis. The uses of maps to better represent distribution of different coefficients is easier to understand in report 2.</p><p>Report 1 uses tools used for analysis of correlation better. Along with the use of maps for spatial analysis of coefficients, it also shows the correlation between elevation and the coefficients. It's a neat analysis.</p><h6>signif</h6><p>1.  Related PRCP & Temperature conclusion with supporting analysis and official data. Consolidated TMIN & TMAX together
2.  Global Warming associated inferred from Statistical analysis - EXCELLENT</p><p>The analysis of the reconstruction of different coefficient in submission 1 seems to make no sense. It only analyzed the coeff_1 and did not explain well what does it mean when coeff_1 is large or small.</p><p>Report 2 uses maps to better explain the distribution of coefficients across different stations, and although it does not affect the final conclusion of both reports, it makes for better statistical analysis of coefficients.</p><p>In general, report 1 provides a better overview and explanation for every aspect of the analysis. It uses heatmaps, maps, correlation matrices, and simple plots at the right places to support its analysis properly.</p><h6>orig</h6><p>Submission 2 provides geographical distribution and associated analysis for coeff_1,2 and 3.</p><p>1.  Performed analysis and conclusion of PRCP, TEMP, SNWD separately. 
2.  SNWD - temporal/location variation analysed.</p><p>It analyzed the pattern of average temperature and drew the conclusion of the trend of global warming.</p><p>Both the reports have derived ideas from the analysis provided by the instructor. However, they don't add any additional detail, or a new statistic as compared to the sample analysis.</p><p>The report 1 differs in only one aspect w.r.t to report 2, but it's an important difference. Report 1 makes an extra effort to evaluate correlations , for eg., between eigen-vectors, elevation-coefficients, that adds an interesting take on the provided data. </p><h6>present</h6><p>Submission 2 provides a more thorough analysis (spatial-temporal and geographical) which therefore more convincing.</p><p>1.  More description and notes around graphs and maps
2. Information presented is more terse and meaningful. 
3. Legends used clearly in maps.
4. Logical conclusion deduced with the support of maps for SNOW and terrain.</p><p>Most of the figures in Submission 2 are not rendered well on Github.</p><p>Report 2 is slightly better in this regard as compared to report 1. The flow of the report follows a proper direction. From PCA to residuals to spatial/temporal analysis. Although there isn't a significant difference between the two reports, the judicial use of figures in report 2 make it slightly better.</p><p>Report 1 is the better one here as well. The explanations are logical and well-supported by providing concise information, as well as a few extra details for coefficients, elevation and spatial analysis of stations. The figures are well-plotted and more informative as compared to report 2.</p><hr><h1>A53070477</h1><h3>Rank: 5&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Score:  -1.2</h3><h6 style='color:red'>Student is submission 1</h6><h6>rigor</h6><p>submission 2 uses graphs to show measurement counts as well.</p><p>1 had analyzed more features</p><p>Submission 2 used the stat tools more rigorously and provided good analysis</p><p>Submission 2 slightly more rigorous</p><p>They used the tools at about the same level.</p><h6>signif</h6><p>Submission 2 fails to add any explanation the figures at the end of the report.</p><p>Some of the conclusions in 2 did not seem to be well supported by the statistics presented</p><p>The analysis provided by Submission 2 was better corresponding to the stat tools used</p><p>Both have use the same tools and similar explanation</p><p>submission 2 had more statistical grounding in their findings.</p><h6>orig</h6><p>Both the notebooks only analyzed in the way as the instructor showed/stated.</p><p>2 did a few other analyses</p><p>Submission 2 used heat maps to identify trends of attrs. over time and rtied drawing some analysis from it.
