Also, for calculation part, both submissions reasoned mathematical theory behind.</p><p>Both use various tools: PCA, distribution, and correlation.</p><h6>signif</h6><p>Although both submissions provide enough statistical support for each section in reports, submission 1 analyzes a more comprehensive range of dataset (i.e. more aspects being inspected) and demonstrates more useful/interesting data analysis. </p><p>Both conclusions relate to their data closely.</p><h6>orig</h6><p>Although submission 1 covers more aspects of the dataset than submission 2, neither submission really goes beyond the provided notebooks. All ideas are from starter notebooks, just with data and inspected measurements changed.</p><p>Submission 1 analyze more about the statistical relation of precipitation between stations; submission 2 analyze more about the station distribution and the climate change.</p><h6>present</h6><p>Submission 1 demonstrates analysis in more visualizable way via histograms, correlation matrix and google maps; while submission 2 does not have a variety of visualizations (partially because it does not have that much content compared to submission 1). Also, submission 2 does not provide visualization for analyzing correlation between precipitation across locations. </p><p>Both presentations are almost similar with few differentiations</p><p>Both has a good presentation.</p><h6 style='color:red'>Student is submission 2</h6><h6>rigor</h6><p>Both the submissions used more or less similar statistical tools in their analysis.</p><h6>signif</h6><p>Submission 2 was more precise about the inferences as compared to submission 1. Every point made was supported with a reasonable explanation that used statistical values and figures.</p><p>Submission 2 lacks proper justification for the reconstruction plots for different positive/negative coefficients.</p><h6>orig</h6><p>The originality was more or less same for both the submissions because Submission 1 went one step ahead to analyze the measurement TOBS as that was the most explained after SNWD; However Submission 2 went in greater detail to analyze the spatial relation between stations, grouping as seen in the Block diagonal. </p><p>Both submissions closely follow instructor's analysis.</p><h6>present</h6><p>Submission 2 was more convincing than Submission 1. For instance, while going ahead with the analysis of residuals for PRCP, Submission 2 justified the reason why PCA wouldn't work so well, with more explanations and graphs. </p><p>Submission 1 provides thorough spatio-temporal and correlation analysis along with a concise conclusion.</p><hr><h1>A53208651</h1><h3>Rank: 3&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Score:  1.0</h3><h6 style='color:red'>Student is submission 1</h6><h6>rigor</h6><p>1 used tools and analyzed in a more thorough way.</p><p>Submission 1 makes slightly greater use of plots and graphs for visualizing data/weather station locations. Uses cumulative distribution graph and mapping for better data visualization. It should be noted that both submissions do not convert the temperature data to Celsius from the raw data collection format resulting in temperatures over 250 Celsius according to their graphs.</p><p>Submission 1 missing some pictures. Submission 1 did comprehensive analysis and looked at the data from so many angles trying to explain behaviors.</p><p>Both submissions  have used statistical tools with almost equal and sufficient rigor.</p><p>Submission 1 used the statistical tools more rigorously, especially the bar besides the map, it is more clear for readers to understand.</p><h6>signif</h6><p>1 used more statistics tools to support and verify the result.</p><p>Submission 1 provides more clearer graphs to support their arguments. Cumulative distribution of residuals and coefficients, clearer mapping of weather stations. Both submissions recognize the low percentage of variance of precipitation data explained by eigenvectors. Submission 1 also recognizes that the area of land sees very very low amounts of snowfall so even though the variance explained for snowfall is high, this is only because there are so few values.</p><p>Logical analysis with proves and conclusion.</p><p>Both submissions supported their conclusions statistically well.</p><p>Submission 1 has much more analysis and conclusions according to its statistical analysis.</p><h6>orig</h6><p>the CDF analysis on coefficients</p><p>Submission ID 1 did not go much further beyond the templates provided in class</p><p>While both reports provide some statistical analysis beyond the instructors, submission 1 demonstrates more originality in the creative use of graphs.

Otherwise, both reports do a good job presenting data and writing clear convincing reports. Submission 1 also does a nice job with bolding certain important pieces. </p><p>Submission 1 was missing some images. Submission 2 was easy to follow.</p><p>sub1 some figures do not render well on either github or local</p><p>Submission 1 was precise in the explanations while Submission 2 was also more intuitive, other than being precise. Submission 2 also represented the reconstructions in a more readable and understandable fashion by separating out the cluttered plots into 4 different plots instead of 1 single plot. </p><p>Just considering the presentation, these two submissions are similar in my opinion.</p><h6 style='color:red'>Student is submission 2</h6><h6>rigor</h6><h6>signif</h6><h6>orig</h6><p>Both submission went beyond analysis provided by instructor though they are comparable</p><h6>present</h6><p>provided better visualization</p><hr><h1>A53213477</h1><h3>Rank: 4&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Score:  0.3</h3><h6 style='color:red'>Student is submission 1</h6><h6>rigor</h6><h6>signif</h6><h6>orig</h6><h6>present</h6><h6 style='color:red'>Student is submission 2</h6><h6>rigor</h6><p>Each submission has analysis of two types of measurements</p><p>In the section of coefficient analysis, submission 1 shows more analysis</p><p>Both reports have used the statistical tools for similar data analysis/graph generation.

Submission 2 may be slightly better since it has extensive analysis such as yearly plot and eigenvectors.</p><h6>signif</h6><p>Submission 2 provided more insights and explanation about Snow and PRCT.</p><p>In depth analysis</p><p>1. Cover the Temporal and Location  distribution for  SNWD in the given  region. 
2.  Performed Ablation of Station observations for SNWD mean coefficients. </p><p>Although it was difficult to make the decision but the inference  in submission 2 for "Geographical distribution of first 4 coefficients" was more interesting than that of submission 1.</p><p>Submission 1 used more plots provided by instructor to better justify their claim.</p><p>Submission 2 tries to provide reasoning for the graphs obtained in it's own words  and tries to reason out and explain the reason behind the statistics observed not copying the format specified by the Instructor.</p><p>CDF analysis was used to validate results which was lacking in submission1.</p><p>Although submission 2 seems to have more statistical data, many of them are from the same tool. I would say both of these two submission have good statistical support and come to the conclusion very naturally.</p><h6>orig</h6><p>Submission 2 Provided more analytics showing year over year analysis and deeper explanation.</p><p>Reconstruction Plots were present</p><p>1. Included the scatter matrix for associating Elevation, Longitude and Latitude. 
2. Identified significant station and region entail the Atlantic Ocean. </p><p>Submission 2 has an additional section where the person showed increasing TMIN over the years. Apart from that both the notebooks used the same/similar statistical tools (graphs) as present in the example report.</p><p>Neither report went beyond the analysis provided by instructor.</p><p>Submission 2 tries to provide reasoning for the graphs obtained in it's own words  and tries to reason out and explain the reason behind the statistics observed not copying the format specified by the Instructor.</p><p>Neither report went beyond the analysis provided by the instructor.</p><p>Both submission use the same statistical tools as used by Instructor for analysis</p><p>Both of them go further beyond the given sample, especially they both visualize the station correlations.</p><h6>present</h6><p>Both of submission were easy to read and great presentation. They provided graphics and good explanation.</p><p>Both have a very clean presentation, 2 pips 1 by slight margins though</p><p>1. Layout and description in logical order and flows naturally.</p><p>Submission 1 fails to maintain same scale in graphs in the sanity check section, making it difficult to analyze graphs.</p><p>The organization of figures in submission 1 was better as compared to submission 2.</p><p>Presentation of both the report is equal, it is almost equal to the format specified by the instructor in the sample report. However I found the Second Report more convincing because of the reasoning provided.</p><p>Submission was better in terms of presentation and in showcasing geographical correlation in weather data.</p><p>Submission 2 does better job at using clear language, order, layout and explanation and is more coherent. The presentation and explanation of probability matrices is especially better. Submission 1 does not use very clear language to explain its analysis and gets a bit confusing.</p><p>Both submissions are great, but submission 2 is better, since it has a clearer layout, for example, it labeled each part(or called session) and labeled each figure.
