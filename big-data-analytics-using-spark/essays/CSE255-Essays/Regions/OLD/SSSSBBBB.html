Report-2 is better than report-1 in originality. Report-1 analyzes the correlation between the measurement types,  between measurement-types and elevation.

Report2 is missing temporal Vs spatial variance analysis</p><p>Submission 2 has PCA analysis.</p><h6>signif</h6><p>Submission 1 lacks numerical explanation.</p><p>Reconstruction explanation really impressed me - This quantitative evaluation of unsupervised model and others in the report illustrates its better statistical support.</p><p>Report2 relatively better than Report1 in explaining the eigenfunctions, coefficients, cumulative distribution. However the of explanation/plot of large negative residuals is confusing. We will never get negative residuals (Their value always stays between 0-1)</p><p> They both used correct graph to support their conclusions. I found the claims about the geographical distribution of first 4 coefficient are not convincing enough. For one thing, I did not find explanations on what solid color/clear color triangles mean in this graph. </p><h6>orig</h6><p>Submission 1 only stops at coefficient analysis</p><p>Correlation being demonstrated on the map makes it more understandable and has gone a step ahead than the analysis of the instructor.</p><p>None of the reports add anything beyond what was provided by the instructor</p><p>Submission 2 has plotted the distribution of the first coefficient and residual.</p><h6>present</h6><p>Pictures in submission 1 is too large.</p><p>Statistical justifications are succinct, has covered all nuances well. </p><p>Report-2 has better organization and write-up. report-1 is in PDF and I did not find corresponding ipython notebook in the github.</p><p>Both reports present the analysis in a clear and convincing way, except I did find some spelling errors in Submission 2. E.g. In residual 2 analysis, "residual1" was typed, and it did not convert F to C and show the values either in the graph or in the wording. However submission 1 decided to show percentage of variance per measurement with one figure per page, which makes it harder to compare one another.</p><hr><h1>A53207678</h1><h3>Rank: 4&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Score:  1.0</h3><h6 style='color:red'>Student is submission 1</h6><h6>rigor</h6><h6>signif</h6><h6>orig</h6><h6>present</h6><h6 style='color:red'>Student is submission 2</h6><h6>rigor</h6><p>It seems that the author of report 2 doesn't understand PCA correctly.</p><p>Reconstruction with coeff and residual</p><p>Submission 1 seems to have not included their pictures</p><p>I think submission1 is a little more accurate.</p><p>Submission 1 is missing.</p><p>Submission 1 use statistical tools more rigorously.</p><h6>signif</h6><p>Explanation of eigen vector for weather.</p><p>Submission2 makes adequate explanation.</p><p>Submission 1 is missing.</p><h6>orig</h6><p>No additional originality.</p><p>Submission 2 uses other methods like regression.</p><p>Submission 1 is missing.</p><p>Both submissions did well in originality</p><h6>present</h6><p>Submission1 has no graphical images.</p><p>Submission 1 is missing.</p><p>Both submissions have good representations.</p><hr><h1>A53097956</h1><h3>Rank: 5&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Score:  -0.4</h3><h6 style='color:red'>Student is submission 1</h6><h6>rigor</h6><p>Both reports use same statistical tools as mentioned in the class/example report.</p><p>Submission 1's stat tools were good and inferred well</p><p>They both use the statistical tools quite well</p><p>These two reports were very similar in statistical rigor, as most of the same techniques were applied. </p><p>Both the submissions lacked some strong rigor in mathematical foundations, but Submission 1 was better, since it had used p-values to calculate correlation dependencies etc.</p><p>Submssion 2 has done a more in depth analysis.</p><h6>signif</h6><p>The analysis provided by Submission 1 was good and made sense.</p><p>Their conclusions both have good statistical support.</p><p>Both submissions gave great statistical support for their conclusions and I do not feel that one exceeded the other.</p><p>Both the submissions had good support for their analysis</p><p>Submssion 2 made bolder conclusions and backed it with reasonable statistical inference.</p><h6>orig</h6><p>submission 2 has done some more analysis to find correlation b/w different readings and elevation and distance from coast etc.</p><p>neither had a good amount of originality, but Submission 1 was better</p><p>Submission 2 analyzed relationship between SNWD and elevation and also used map to visualise the SNWD, which is very clear</p><p>Submission 1 and 2 both had great statistical rigor, and I feel both deserve an A+.
