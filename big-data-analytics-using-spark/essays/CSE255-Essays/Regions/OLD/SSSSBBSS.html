Used tools well to capture the characteristics of given data
2. Used proper tools of the analysis. </p><p>Submission 1 seems not explain the CDF figure of residuals correctly especially for "the number of instances giving a certain residual value increases". In the PCA analysis of correlation matrix, author doesn't interpret the matrix correctly (The matrix is reordered according to the coefficient of PCA components while the author thinks the order is fixed). </p><p>Second person has used very less statistical tools.</p><h6>signif</h6><p>Reconstruction explanation really impressed me - This quantitative evaluation of unsupervised model and others in the report illustrates its better statistical support.</p><p>Submission 1 has better statistical support for their conclusions.</p><p>Both give convincing statistical results.</p><p>1. The explanations were justified well with the analysis. I think there is some problem with significance analysis. The 0.4 base isn't correct for this data.
2. The analysis was justified for the hypothesis but better explanations were possible as the final note.</p><p>Several parts of the analysis of residual of PRCP in submission 1 is wrong</p><p>First person did in-depth analysis and provided enough support for their conclusions.</p><h6>orig</h6><p>Correlation being demonstrated on the map makes it more understandable and has gone a step ahead than the analysis of the instructor.</p><p>None of the reports went further beyond the analysis provided by the Instructor.</p><p>Submission 1 provides more analysis on the residuals.</p><p>1. Did the analysis from all the notebooks but not more than that.
2. Did analysis from all the notebooks.</p><p>Both of them only use instructor's notebooks</p><p>First person has analyzed the reconstructions and eigen decomposition of P-norm matrix well. Second person didn't do anything extra.</p><h6>present</h6><p>Statistical justifications are succinct, has covered all nuances well. </p><p>Submission 1 is better.</p><p>Submission 1 give a clearer analysis and provide more convincing figures to support the analysis.</p><p>1. The flow and the presentation of the notebook was good.
2. The presentation was good and clean.</p><p>Submission 1 still keeps the top 2 cells which have nothing to do with the report/ figure mission 1 sanity check. A SNWD trend figure is placed in the  residual section which has nothing to do with the context

Submission 2 includes several typos, a figure is missing.</p><p>Overall, the first person's report is very well organized and provides good explanations.</p><h6 style='color:red'>Student is submission 2</h6><h6>rigor</h6><p>Both the reports have used the exact same techniques to analyze their regions.</p><p>Submission 1 and 2 used similar tools for analyzing SNWD. However, Submission 1 analyzed TOBS as well in a detailed manner.</p><h6>signif</h6><p>Once again all the inferences drawn from their graphs are similar.</p><p>Submission 1 explained some of the claims with more mathematical and statistical detail (such as some of the data for TOBS) as compared to Submission 2.</p><h6>orig</h6><p>Both the reports have performed the geographical analysis on SNWD coefficients and temporal analysis of TOBS Coefficients.</p><p>Most of the analysis in both the reports used the template from the class report. However, some of the analysis related to relationship between SNWD and elevation was original in Submission 1.</p><h6>present</h6><p>Overall structure of the two reports looks the same, as both the reports follow the exact same procedure to analyze their reports.</p><p>In terms of explanation, layout and clarity, Submission 1 was the better out of the two in my opinion.</p><hr><h1>A53209077</h1><h3>Rank: 4&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Score:  0.0</h3><h6 style='color:red'>Student is submission 1</h6><h6>rigor</h6><p>Second report used more tools like maps to plot triangular representation of coefficients.</p><p>Both reports are similar</p><p>Rigorousness lacks on both reports. Only to basic level.</p><p>Submission 2 use the tools more to analyze why the method works or not.</p><p>They both just use what is taught in class and make no mistakes on these tools.</p><h6>signif</h6><p>I think report 1 had clearer use of tools for interpretation of results.</p><p>Both reports are similar</p><p>Both reports are just average.</p><p>Submission 2 did a better job on the reconstruction part than submission 1.</p><p>They arrive at the same conclusion using the same set of tools.  It is hard to say which one is better.</p><h6>orig</h6><p>I feel none of the reports used more data analysis beyond instructors, everything was from class notebooks</p><p>Both reports are similar</p><p>Both reports have not covered extra from instructor's sample.</p><p>Submission 2 did more analysis on why the reconstruction doesn't work well.</p><p>They both act poorly at this part.</p><h6>present</h6><p>
This report presented the content in slightly better way</p><p>Both reports are similar</p><p>Presentation on both reports are not too great. Report 2 has images with scroll/hide comments on it and some spelling mistakes. Report 1 has listed weblink that takes to Boston climate data page.</p><p>Submission 1 didn't change the tile in the reconstruction part, which can be confusing given that we don't know which graph has the largest or smallest coefficients, or the residual value. On the other hand, they both lack overall conclusion.</p><p>I would say submission 1 arranges these figures in a more meaningful way and has a clear conclusion than submission 2.</p><h6 style='color:red'>Student is submission 2</h6><h6>rigor</h6><p>What's extra in Submission 2 (BUT NOT BY MUCH) - Dependency matrix, calculated normalized log probability but also didn't state as much as submission 1 for 'variation by station/year'</p><p>residual analysis</p><h6>signif</h6><p>Both did PCA - but submission 1 drew incorrect conclusion and analyzed TOBS instead.</p><p>used multiple coefficients of eigen vectors</p><h6>orig</h6><p>Both were within the realm of the 7 notebooks, but more than sample report.</p><p>Geographical analysis</p><h6>present</h6><p>The content aside, both followed same structure.

I found the claims about the geographical distribution of first 4 coefficient are not convincing enough. For one thing, I did not find explanations on what solid color/clear color triangles mean in this graph. </p><p>Though, first person has done less work, the statistical support they provide for their conclusions is at par with the second person.</p><h6>orig</h6><p>Submission 1 only stops at coefficient analysis</p><p>Submission 2 has plotted the distribution of the first coefficient and residual.</p><p>Second person has analyzed the Geographical distribution of first 3 coefficients for SNWD. Apart from this, the reports are at same level of originality.</p><h6>present</h6><p>Pictures in submission 1 is too large.</p><p>Both reports present the analysis in a clear and convincing way, except I did find some spelling errors in Submission 2. E.g. In residual 2 analysis, "residual1" was typed, and it did not convert F to C and show the values either in the graph or in the wording. However submission 1 decided to show percentage of variance per measurement with one figure per page, which makes it harder to compare one another.</p><p>First person has a lot of Typos in their report (which looks like is due to copy pasting their text).
