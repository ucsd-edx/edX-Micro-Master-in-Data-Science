They can't be more than 250 for mean.  So submission 1 is more rigor</p><p>Report in submission 2 explained with a statistical test.</p><p>It is clear that Submission 2 involve with more analyzing tools than Submission 1. For example, Submission 2 uses hypothesis test to analyze the correlation between two fixed stations, with detailed results such as p-value histogram. However, Submission 1 had nothing related to this important part.</p><p>submission 2 performed sanity check before going deeper in the analysis</p><p>Report 2 doesn't mention needless analysis done on Snow in Georgia region.</p><p>Both the submissions have replicated all the tests  given by the professor.</p><h6>signif</h6><p>Submission 2 seems to have better interpretation of the charts.</p><p>But both had chosen to analyze snow depth, but it rarely snows in that area, hence data for that measurement will be very sparse. But second submission did analysis in greater depth.</p><p>Both reports showed reasonable significance. However, as mentioned before, Submission 2 implemented more analysis tools, thus, it results in more convincing results. One significant example is the conclusion in Submission 2, which claims "correlation of whether rain or not in some locations", resulting from the hypothesis test part.</p><p>Submission 2 has geographical analysis.</p><p>They both chose SNWD as main factor to analyze and received similar results of ~80% of variance being explained by the top 5 eigen-vectors. However, submission 2 went deeper and analyzed coefficients and variations of timing of snow, which makes the entire argument better supported.</p><p>both reports only show significance of coefficient 1. but report one does it better.</p><p>Submission 2 has given the correlation matrix to find if the stations nearby are correlated while submission 1 has not plotted the correlation matrix.</p><h6>orig</h6><p>Submission1 and Submission 2 are both very close in this category.  But Submission 2 presented more charts but they are similar to what our professor has already shown</p><p>Submission 2 showed better originality. Several points can be noticed in Submission 2. For example, it involved with the geographical distribution of top 3 coefficients, while submission one just simply showed the map. Also, Submission 2 includes detailed hypothesis test analysis, while Submission 1 didn't. Actually, Submission 1 seems in the framework of the sample report.</p><p>1 is analyzed with formula</p><p>They both did not go much further in terms of analysis.</p><p>Both submissions have not gone beyond the analysis provided by the instructor, but have replicated everything given the instructor.</p><h6>present</h6><p>Submission 2 seems to have a better presentation overall</p><p>Information presented in submission 2 is much clearer is conveying the weather analysis for the region with detailed explanation and statistical analysis.</p><p>In submission 1, I notice that it suddenly jumped to the PRCP analysis from the SNWD analysis, with fragmentary conclusion of the previous part. On the other hand, Submission 2 organized much better. from data check to Variance analysis, following with the PCA analysis and hypothesis test, respectively. </p><p>submission 2 covered more contents and made the analysis fuller in supporting the conclusions and have better visualizations than submission 1.</p><p>Both the reports have given a thorough explanation with all the graphs and tests given by the instructor.</p><hr><h1>A53211130</h1><h3>Rank: 2&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Score:  0.25</h3><h6 style='color:red'>Student is submission 1</h6><h6>rigor</h6><p>In submission 2, there is a abnormal not monotonic increasing pattern for the Percentage of variance explained in TMIN but no analysis or explanation for this abnormal pattern.</p><p>Submission 2 used more statistical tools</p><p>Page 404  when linking of ID - 118 is.</p><p>https://github.com/ucsd-edx/CSE255-DSE230-Grading/tree/master/118 - Page not found</p><p>More analysis done on snow data</p><p>The 2 submission are quite close on this grading.
