Additionally, Submission 1 used topographical map in the graphical distribution of coefficient part, as the exercise suggested in the notebook. </p><p>Submission 1 was missing</p><p>Submission 1 only contains figures without providing corresponding analysis.</p><h6>signif</h6><p>Submission 2 has better significance, especially in the part which talks about the RMS. In that part, Submission 2 clearly shows the tendency that  RMS "is nearly constant" when ''continuously subtracting mean of two factors". It is an interesting result which cannot be found in Submission 1.</p><p>Submission 1 was missing, 2 provides a basic statistical support.</p><p>Submission 1 only contains figures without providing corresponding analysis.</p><h6>orig</h6><p>Submission 2 and Submission 1 both have original results, but the former has more than the latter one. For example, Submission 2 came up with the question about whether the climate is going warmer over the years which is interesting to me. Also, it gave the evaluation about the SNWD and PRCP from the analysis of data.</p><p>Submission 1 missing, 2 lacked originality.</p><p>Submission 2 analyzes more on the elevation with PRCP and SNOW.</p><h6>present</h6><p>Frameworks of both submission are similar, however, submission 1 represents better compared to submission 2. In submission 2, several figures of map isn't showed in a clear way, where it whether didn't contain all the data area, or the data area is too small in the map. Submission 1 treats the map problem better and more clear than submission 2.</p><p>Submission 1 was missing, 2 was okay.</p><p>Submission 1 provide only obscure figures without any words while submission 2 provide good explanations on each figure.</p><h6 style='color:red'>Student is submission 2</h6><h6>rigor</h6><p>S1 only contains the basic notebooks, no report.</p><p>Both Submission 1 & 2 reports use the statistical tools in a equally rigorous manner.

It also draws good conclusions based on the statistical analysis performed.
Although submission 1 report has also drawn meaningful conclusions, it fails to go into the depth of analyzing the results.</p><p>177 has a missing report. 013 did a good job</p><hr><h1>A53212862</h1><h3>Rank: 2&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Score:  0.0</h3><h6 style='color:red'>Student is submission 1</h6><h6>rigor</h6><h6>signif</h6><h6>orig</h6><h6>present</h6><h6 style='color:red'>Student is submission 2</h6><h6>rigor</h6><p>Both use various tools: PCA, variation and correlation.</p><p>They are both very good!</p><p>Submission 2 has utilized an varied array of techniques to perform analysis with a lot more rigor in comparison to submission 1.</p><p>Submission 1 lists the data and makes scatter plots which is quite impressive.</p><h6>signif</h6><p>Both has enough graph and data.</p><p>Both use lots of statistical support to state their conclusions; given enough support to state their conclusion.</p><p>Both are very rigorous in statistical analysing</p><p>Submission 1 has tried explain in underlying phenomenon in a much better manner in comparison to submission 2 using statistical methods, while submission 2 has explained using visualization.</p><p>The most correlation exists between the mean and first eigenvector and the corresponding figure show the result quite clearly.</p><h6>orig</h6><p>Have Geospatial Trends and Pairwise Relation Analysis.</p><p>Both go beyond the analysis by explaining more about the distribution and correlation.</p><p>Though both the reports have performed comprehensive analysis on the given data, both the reports haven't gone too much beyond the analysis provided by the professor.</p><p>Submission 1 also does some work on data cleaning and make plots including kernel density estimate plots.</p><h6>present</h6><p>Both present the content clearly.</p><p>Both have a good presentation.</p><p>The second is slightly better</p><p>The visualization provided by submission 2 is much more comprehensive in comparison to submission 1.</p><p>Submission provides more persuasive evidence by combining more statistical analyses.</p><hr><h1>A53104529</h1><h3>Rank: 3&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Score:  -0.166666666667</h3><h6 style='color:red'>Student is submission 1</h6><h6>rigor</h6><p>Report of submission ID - 037 is missing</p><p>Submission 1 is missing.</p><h6>signif</h6><p>Report of submission ID - 037 is missing</p><p>Submission 1 is missing.</p><h6>orig</h6><p>Report of submission ID - 037 is missing</p><p>Submission 1 is missing.</p><h6>present</h6><p>Report of submission ID - 037 is missing</p><p>Submission 1 is missing.</p><p>Submission 2 was very small and did not touch on a lot of topics</p><h6 style='color:red'>Student is submission 2</h6><h6>rigor</h6><p>Submission one sticks to predefined format.</p><p>Submission 2 doesn't justify the mismatch of PRCP in sanity check</p><p>Report for 037 is missing.

Submission 1 anaylized two features in the report, but didn't went quite further beyond the analysis provided by the instructor.</p><h6>present</h6><p>Submission 1 is presented well.</p><p>Submission 1 does have problems:
Submission 1 seems to use wrong figures in PCA analysis of eig4 of SNWD which in turn result in wrong result.
Several figures are missing.

But submission 1's report uses sufficient figures and justifications to support conclusions while submission 1 does not explain the figure and justify its conclusion adequately.</p><p>Sub2 has too many dataframe exhibitions.</p><p>Report for 037 is missing.</p><hr><h1>A53091724</h1><h3>Rank: 4&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Score:  -0.777777777778</h3><h6 style='color:red'>Student is submission 1</h6><h6>rigor</h6><p>Besides the tools mentioned in homework, submission 1 also uses Chisquare-Test to verify whether the PRCP of each month is the same.</p><p>New tools were used</p><p>presented P values in the correlations in the report. Analysis of 1 is better in statistical sense. In 2, the regression does not present why such features should be used in regression.</p><h6>signif</h6><p>These two submission are written according to the sample report. However, submission 1 provide better statistical support for its conclusions because it provide the figure about distribution of the residuals and the coefficients of SNWD while submission 2 misses this part.</p><p>2 has better statistical support, as all the conclusions are consistent with its analysis tools as well as the analysis outcome.</p><h6>orig</h6><p>Submission 1 provides more detailed analysis about the data distribution in terms of years in section weather analysis - visualization.</p><p>Regression is used in 2.</p><h6>present</h6><p>Although submission 1 has a more detailed analysis, it has some spelling mistakes and just use the names of ipython files as the titles of each sections.</p><p>Size of images and writing was less in submission 1</p><h6 style='color:red'>Student is submission 2</h6><h6>rigor</h6><p>Submission 2 delved into more stat tools</p><h6>signif</h6><p>Submission 2 has not provided a good analysis of the stat tools that were used. However, there are many plots in both reports which do not help in concluding or inferring anything.</p><h6>orig</h6><p>Submission 2 did try to use few other methods to help judge the climate analysis</p><h6>present</h6><p>Submission 2 did not provide the correct intro and the region identified was also wrong.

Submission 2 has moderately decent statistical tools used.</p><p>111 used more tools, such as correlation analysis, and statistcal testing, in addition to the tools used by 116.</p><p>They both just use what is taught in class and make no mistakes on these tools.</p><h6>signif</h6><p>Submission 1 used the reconstructions to help support their conclusions.</p><p>Conclusion derived using RMS values appears wrong for notebook1</p><p>No explanations at all in submission 1. Submission 2 provides some numerical analysis to support explanations.</p><p>Unable to follow or see the importance of 116's 'The variation on the location is caused by city' section.  111 looked at statistical signifiance, but did not finish calculating it or clearly conclude the section. But 111 did more analysis and had more statistical support</p><p>They arrive at the same conclusion using the same set of tools.  It is hard to say which one is better.</p><h6>orig</h6><p>Submission 1 went looked at other weather measurements</p><p>Although both the notebooks did not go much beyond the classroom menu, the first notebook does show geographic distribution of various coefficients on the map with similar coefficients lying nearby to each other.</p><p>None has any drastic originality apart from using different measurements.</p><p>Neither report did much beyond the professor's analysis</p><p>They both act poorly at this part.</p><h6>present</h6><p>Submission 1 had in depth analysis and the graphics helped illustrate that.</p><p>It is a close call but submission 1 presents proper conclusion section and overall things in a better way (ignoring the RMS thing).</p><p>Submission 1 has no supporting notes. Submission 2 does, and it is (moderately) convincing.</p><p>116 wrote a lot more explanation/analysis of his/her findings, making it clearer and easier to interpret. 111 had a lot of graphs/data but less analysis.</p><p>I would say submission 1 arranges these figures in a more meaningful way and has a clear conclusion than submission 2.</p><hr><h1>A53219654</h1><h3>Rank: 6&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Score:  -1.8</h3><h6 style='color:red'>Student is submission 1</h6><h6>rigor</h6><h6>signif</h6><h6>orig</h6><h6>present</h6><h6 style='color:red'>Student is submission 2</h6><h6>rigor</h6><p>Submission 1 has performed a structured breakdown of the data using eigen vector reconstruction which wasn't present in submission 2. Submission 2 lacks comprehensive analysis of the data.</p><p>Submission 2 though did very minimal analysis but it made use of statistical tools given by the professor for calculating the Variance explained and eigen coefficients however Submission 1 did not include any PCA analysis, Correlation plots, eigen coefficients reconstructions as discussed by professor in class.</p><p>They both don't have the scale of the temperature charts correctly labeled, but Submission 1 is definitely more rigor</p><p>The temperature and precipitation data in submission 2 was not converted to right units thus hard to compare with external data.And the Percentage o variance of TMIN is wrong in submission 2.</p><h6>signif</h6><p>Submission 1 tries to explain the statistical plots obtained and use to drive additional conclusions. Submission 2 just provides a brief overview of the conclusions.</p><p>Submission 1 provided more charts in the presentation.</p><p>Submission 2 in the examples of reconstructions the coefficients values are not given thus hard to support the conclusions.And there is no p-value or correlation data showing the temporal and spatial correlations.</p><h6>orig</h6><p>Submission 1 has tried to analyze the skewness of data and predict if the global warming issue has an impact on the climatic patterns obtained. Submission 2 lacks any additional analysis.</p><p>Submission 1 did not use any of the code provided by professor and made a unique report by giving analysis on TMIN, TMAX and SNOW depth, though it was very minimal and did not contain any PCA analysis, Eigen vector coefficients, correlation graphs but when i compare it to submission 2 in terms of originality, it stands out.</p><p>both not good.</p><p>Used the same instructor tools to make similar conclusions</p><p>Submission 1 has simply gone a lot further beyond in providing evidence.</p><p>Submission 1 gives latitude span and longitude span to lock the location of the destination which is smart.
Submission 2 is not even complete.</p><h6>present</h6><p>Submission 1 has tried to provide explicit possible reasoning to explain the phenomenon observed but Submission 2 seems to lack a structured report.</p><p>Submission 1 had better presentation though the analysis done was very minimal but the presentation skills were good.</p><p>better charts</p><p>The overall presentation of Submission 1 is a lot more complete</p><p>As presented before the submission 2 is not complete, figures was does not have axes labels and data was not in right units. Submission 1 is much better in the mentioned fields, but the author can have better presentation by reorganizing data in more meaningful section titles. </p>
