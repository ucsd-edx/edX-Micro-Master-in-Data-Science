Cumulative distribution of residuals and coefficients, clearer mapping of weather stations. Both submissions recognize the low percentage of variance of precipitation data explained by eigenvectors. Submission 1 also recognizes that the area of land sees very very low amounts of snowfall so even though the variance explained for snowfall is high, this is only because there are so few values.</td>
