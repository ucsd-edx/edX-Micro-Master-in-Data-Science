      <td><p style='color:red'>Worse</p>Both report use similar PCA based method to analyze the data. Tools they both implement include variance analysis, PCA eigen-vector analysis, residual analysis, hypothesis test and visualization in map. However, Submission 2 shows more detailed implementation in the tools. For example, Submission 2 used the visualization method of the PCA coefficient as we disscussed in the lecture. Also, from the varience analysis, their data showed that TBOS is also a measurement that is suitable for PCA analysis. Only Submission 2 go into these data.</td>
      <td><p style='color:red'>Worse</p>Submission 2 clearly shows more originality than submission 1. In Submission 1, I can see some sentences are similar to that in the sample report, such as ''It makes sense that SNWD ... between the same date on different years."  Submission 2 doesn't have this kind of problem. Although the structure of the sample report can be used, but common conclusion in similar words should  be avoided. On the other hand, Submission 2 showed some result beyond just the code in the given notebooks, such as the figure of map which visualized PCA coefficient in triangles as professor mentioned in class. Also, Submission 2 noticed that the TBOS is also a good measurement to analyze via PCA, while Submission 1 only discussed SNWD measurement, like just following the sample report to me.</td>
      <td><p style='color:red'>Worse</p>More significance can be found in Submission 2. One important example can be found in the hypothesis test part. Submission 2 first use the p-value histogram to show distribution of the p-value, leading to the conclusion that the correlations between the two stations are very weak. Then it gives the figures that show the p-value of specific stations, which further confirm the conclusion. On the other hand, Submission 1 seems just paste the station p-value figure to the report without careful  analysis and thus no profound conclusion. Similar comparison can also be noticed in graphical distribution of coefficient part, where Submission 2 shows top 4 coefficients and Submission 1 has only the first one.</td>
      <td><p style='color:red'>Worse</p>Submission 2 organizes its report better than Submission 1. Submission 2 organizes its report in a clean manner. It first shows the check of whole data set, then analyzed SNWD, TBOS and PRCP measurements respectively, in the section of each measurement, it introduce different aspect of the data. If the data has high variance in top eigen-vectors, Submission 2 then implemented the PCA method. For those measurement with low variance, like PRCP, Submission 2 also tried to analyze them in other aspect, like monthly precipitation analysis. I notice although analyzing different aspect, Submission can show them in a clear way for readers. However, Submission 1 confused reader with unclear organization. For example, it mixed graphical distribution of coefficient with hypothesis test part in an unclear way.</td>

However, Submission 1 had nothing related to this important part.</td>
      <td><p style='color:red'>Worse</p>Submission 2 showed better originality. Several points can be noticed in Submission 2.

Also, Submission 2 includes detailed hypothesis test analysis, while Submission 1 didn't. Actually, Submission 1 seems in the framework of the sample report.</td>
      <td><p style='color:red'>Worse</p>Both reports showed reasonable significance. However, as mentioned before, Submission 2 implemented more analysis tools, thus, it results in more convincing results. One significant example is the conclusion in Submission 2, which claims "correlation of whether rain or not in some locations", resulting from the hypothesis test part.</td>
      <td><p style='color:red'>Worse</p>In submission 1, I notice that it suddenly jumped to the PRCP analysis from the SNWD analysis, with fragmentary conclusion of the previous part.

Cumulative distribution of residuals and coefficients, clearer mapping of weather stations. Both submissions recognize the low percentage of variance of precipitation data explained by eigenvectors.
