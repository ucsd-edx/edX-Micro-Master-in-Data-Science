      <td><p style='color:red'>Worse</p>Both report use similar PCA based method to analyze the data. Tools they both implement include variance analysis, PCA eigen-vector analysis, residual analysis, hypothesis test and visualization in map. However, Submission 2 shows more detailed implementation in the tools. For example, Submission 2 used the visualization method of the PCA coefficient as we disscussed in the lecture. Also, from the varience analysis, their data showed that TBOS is also a measurement that is suitable for PCA analysis. Only Submission 2 go into these data.</td>
      <td><p style='color:red'>Worse</p>Submission 2 clearly shows more originality than submission 1. In Submission 1, I can see some sentences are similar to that in the sample report, such as ''It makes sense that SNWD ... between the same date on different years."  Submission 2 doesn't have this kind of problem. Although the structure of the sample report can be used, but common conclusion in similar words should  be avoided. On the other hand, Submission 2 showed some result beyond just the code in the given notebooks, such as the figure of map which visualized PCA coefficient in triangles as professor mentioned in class. Also, Submission 2 noticed that the TBOS is also a good measurement to analyze via PCA, while Submission 1 only discussed SNWD measurement, like just following the sample report to me.</td>
      <td><p style='color:red'>Worse</p>More significance can be found in Submission 2. One important example can be found in the hypothesis test part. Submission 2 first use the p-value histogram to show distribution of the p-value, leading to the conclusion that the correlations between the two stations are very weak. Then it gives the figures that show the p-value of specific stations, which further confirm the conclusion. On the other hand, Submission 1 seems just paste the station p-value figure to the report without careful  analysis and thus no profound conclusion. Similar comparison can also be noticed in graphical distribution of coefficient part, where Submission 2 shows top 4 coefficients and Submission 1 has only the first one.</td>
      <td><p style='color:red'>Worse</p>Submission 2 organizes its report better than Submission 1. Submission 2 organizes its report in a clean manner. It first shows the check of whole data set, then analyzed SNWD, TBOS and PRCP measurements respectively, in the section of each measurement, it introduce different aspect of the data. If the data has high variance in top eigen-vectors, Submission 2 then implemented the PCA method. For those measurement with low variance, like PRCP, Submission 2 also tried to analyze them in other aspect, like monthly precipitation analysis. I notice although analyzing different aspect, Submission can show them in a clear way for readers. However, Submission 1 confused reader with unclear organization. For example, it mixed graphical distribution of coefficient with hypothesis test part in an unclear way.</td>

      <td><p style='color:red'>Worse</p>It is clear that Submission 2 involve with more analyzing tools than Submission 1. For example, Submission 2 uses hypothesis test to analyze the correlation between two fixed stations, with detailed results such as p-value histogram. However, Submission 1 had nothing related to this important part.</td>
      <td><p style='color:red'>Worse</p>Submission 2 showed better originality. Several points can be noticed in Submission 2. For example, it involved with the geographical distribution of top 3 coefficients, while submission one just simply showed the map. Also, Submission 2 includes detailed hypothesis test analysis, while Submission 1 didn't. Actually, Submission 1 seems in the framework of the sample report.</td>
      <td><p style='color:red'>Worse</p>Both reports showed reasonable significance. However, as mentioned before, Submission 2 implemented more analysis tools, thus, it results in more convincing results. One significant example is the conclusion in Submission 2, which claims "correlation of whether rain or not in some locations", resulting from the hypothesis test part.</td>
      <td><p style='color:red'>Worse</p>In submission 1, I notice that it suddenly jumped to the PRCP analysis from the SNWD analysis, with fragmentary conclusion of the previous part. On the other hand, Submission 2 organized much better. from data check to Variance analysis, following with the PCA analysis and hypothesis test, respectively.</td>

      <td><p style='color:green'>Better</p>Both submissions uses plenty of analysis methods, such as hypothesis test and PCA analysis. But Submission 1 is a bit better, since it used graphical distribution of top 4 coefficients of temperature and precipitation, with visualization in triangles as we discussed in class and circle symbols respectively.</td>
      <td><p style='color:grey'>Equal Originality</p>Both submissions implement similar tools, including PCA analysis, hypothesis test and graphical distribution coefficient. Based on same data and similar analytical tools, I'd like to regard the two reports with equal originality.</td>
      <td><p style='color:red'>Worse</p>Similar tools are implemented in both submissions. Submission 1 has some flaws in its analysis of hypothesis test part. However, Submission 2 shows more significance. For example, it can properly treat with the hypothesis test results, with more detailed analysis about the correlation between stations.</td>
      <td><p style='color:green'>Better</p>Although with similar tools used by two submissions, Submission 1 organize the reports better than Submission 2.

Additionally, Submission 1 used topographical map in the graphical distribution of coefficient part, as the exercise suggested in the notebook.</td>
      <td><p style='color:red'>Worse</p>Submission 2 and Submission 1 both have original results, but the former has more than the latter one. For example, Submission 2 came up with the question about whether the climate is going warmer over the years which is interesting to me. Also, it gave the evaluation about the SNWD and PRCP from the analysis of data.</td>
      <td><p style='color:red'>Worse</p>Submission 2 has better significance, especially in the part which talks about the RMS. In that part, Submission 2 clearly shows the tendency that  RMS "is nearly constant" when ''continuously subtracting mean of two factors". It is an interesting result which cannot be found in Submission 1.</td>
      <td><p style='color:green'>Better</p>Frameworks of both submission are similar, however, submission 1 represents better compared to submission 2. In submission 2, several figures of map isn't showed in a clear way, where it whether didn't contain all the data area, or the data area is too small in the map. Submission 1 treats the map problem better and more clear than submission 2.</td>

      <td><p style='color:red'>Worse</p>Submission 2 is definitely better. It organized this report with plenty pre-check in the beginning, fruitless discussions of data in the middle and a nice conclusion with open questions for further discussions. Also, pretty tables and figures well organized in Submission 2, show clear better and more convincing presentation.</td>
