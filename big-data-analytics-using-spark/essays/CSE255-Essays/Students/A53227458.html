      <td><p style='color:red'>Worse</p>They were both almost equal, but submission 1 used the tools more rigorously for the measurement of importance (SNWD), which stood out for me.</td>
      <td><p style='color:green'>Better</p>Submission 2 was clearly more original in various aspects, such as correlation matrix, different maps, etc.</td>
      <td><p style='color:red'>Worse</p>Submission 1 was focussed on SNWD and supported its conclusions well with supporting figures and tables and with technical explanation wherever necessary. Also, the analysis was more streamlined and the statistics provided were explanatory for the conclusions drawn.</td>
      <td><p style='color:red'>Worse</p>Both the submissions were well presented. However, in my opinion, Submission 1 was presented in a more formal manner and with better clarity. The tables, figures, explanation and conclusion were directly related to now another and well presented as a "story".</td>

Almost all original ideas are from provided notebooks, with only data and inspected measurements changed.</td>
      <td><p style='color:grey'>Equal Significance</p>Both submissions cover a fairly comprehensive range of the dataset, and follow proper statistical analysis steps which ensure sufficient statistical support for conclusions.</td>
      <td><p style='color:green'>Better</p>submission 2 demonstrates a better presentation that figures/graphs are properly positioned and sized, while submission 1 does not pay too much attention on formatting, which makes some figures oversized and pushed down to another page. Also, submission 2 as a repot is more professional and is easier to follow (eg. it has summary and conclusion sections.)</td>
