Additionally, Submission 1 used topographical map in the graphical distribution of coefficient part, as the exercise suggested in the notebook.</td>
      <td><p style='color:red'>Worse</p>Submission 2 and Submission 1 both have original results, but the former has more than the latter one. For example, Submission 2 came up with the question about whether the climate is going warmer over the years which is interesting to me. Also, it gave the evaluation about the SNWD and PRCP from the analysis of data.</td>
      <td><p style='color:red'>Worse</p>Submission 2 has better significance, especially in the part which talks about the RMS. In that part, Submission 2 clearly shows the tendency that  RMS "is nearly constant" when ''continuously subtracting mean of two factors". It is an interesting result which cannot be found in Submission 1.</td>
      <td><p style='color:green'>Better</p>Frameworks of both submission are similar, however, submission 1 represents better compared to submission 2. In submission 2, several figures of map isn't showed in a clear way, where it whether didn't contain all the data area, or the data area is too small in the map. Submission 1 treats the map problem better and more clear than submission 2.</td>

It also draws good conclusions based on the statistical analysis performed.\nAlthough submission 1 report has also drawn meaningful conclusions, it fails to go into the depth of analyzing the results.</td>
