      <td><p style='color:grey'>Equal Originality</p>While report 2 provides an in-depth analysis, it does not try to include a new statistic/insight for the data. However, it details the existing analysis very nicely. Over-all, neither of the reports go further than the analysis provided by the instructor.</td>
      <td><p style='color:red'>Worse</p>Report 2 provides an analysis of coefficients that is similar to the one in report 1. However, the analysis is in-depth and supports the graphs much better than report 1. The analysis seems perfectly in sync with the conclusions, and the level of detail observed in the percentages of analysis is remarkable.</td>
      <td><p style='color:red'>Worse</p>Report 2 is clear winner here. The analysis provided in a table-format is clear to understand, and is supported beautifully with the detailed explanations at the important parts of the report, such as the analysis of the coefficients and residuals.</td>

Report-2 included results from several statistical tools but the explanation was not satisfactory.</td>
