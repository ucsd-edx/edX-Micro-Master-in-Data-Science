      <td><p style='color:red'>Worse</p>I would say submission 2 is slightly more original because it studies droughts in Alabama.</td>
      <td><p style='color:red'>Worse</p>Submission 2 uses variance of methods (graph virtualization) and outside sources to support its conclusion while submission 1 uses only reconstructions to support its conclusion.</td>
      <td><p style='color:red'>Worse</p>I would say submission 2 is slightly more convincing because its virtualization is pretty while submission 1 also has plenty of virtualization, but more focuses on data analysis and contributes little to conclusion.</td>

      <td><p style='color:green'>Better</p>I was very impressed with both reports but 012 did more original research, specifically on lat/long and elevation with regard to TOBS. 012 presented data in a more original way (it was less similar to the professor's analysis)</td>
      <td><p style='color:red'>Worse</p>176 examined the statistical significance of his/her results, which set him apart from 012.</td>
      <td><p style='color:green'>Better</p>Both presentations were very good, but 012 was clearer and more convincing. His/her graphs were also easier to read and more concise. He/she pulled in outside sources, making his/her report more interesting and well-founded. 176's presentation was also good, but  'distribution after residuals' graph was unclear and hard to interpret</td>

As 2 showed some extra analysis on whether elevation and temperature are correlated, the graph does not seem to contribute to the analysis in the report. But overall 1 is better than 2.</td>
