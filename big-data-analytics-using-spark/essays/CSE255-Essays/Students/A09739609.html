      <td><p style='color:red'>Worse</p>Submission 1 included almost all of the Instructor's analysis + further insight into which factors determine coefficients as well as spacial vs temporal analysis (which I am not sure is actually correct, but well thought out). Submission 2 only included a fraction of the Instructor's analysis and did not go beyond in any way.</td>
      <td><p style='color:red'>Worse</p>Submission one gave a thorough analysis for statistical methods performed, and  had clear progression from one topic to the next. Submission two gave a much shorter and less thorough description of his findings.</td>
      <td><p style='color:red'>Worse</p>As stated above, submission 1's report was thorough and creative. Submission 2's report was clear but lacked many important aspects of analysis.</td>
