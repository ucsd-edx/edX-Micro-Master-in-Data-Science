      <td><p style='color:grey'>Equal Significance</p>Although submission 2 seems to have more statistical data, many of them are from the same tool. I would say both of these two submission have good statistical support and come to the conclusion very naturally.</td>
      <td><p style='color:red'>Worse</p>Both submissions are great, but submission 2 is better, since it has a clearer layout, for example, it labeled each part(or called session) and labeled each figure. The whole report of submission 2 is easy to read and understood by reviewers.</td>
