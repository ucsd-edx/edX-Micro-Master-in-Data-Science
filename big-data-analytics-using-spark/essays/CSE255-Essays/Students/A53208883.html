      <td><p style='color:red'>Worse</p>Submission 1 is similar to the sample report. Submission 2 went a little further to do the residual analysis of SNWD. It did a little more check of why there's little correlation between stations regarding snow depth.</td>
      <td><p style='color:grey'>Equal Significance</p>Both did fine work on supporting the conclusions. Submission 1 gave analysis on the eigen-vectors and on the correlation of stations. Submission 2 also gave the explanation for not performing the reordering the dependency matrices.</td>

      <td><p style='color:green'>Better</p>In the PCA analysis, the author of submission 2 analyzes five eigenvectors which I think is not necessary. Since the fourth and fifth eigenvector can explain little variance and the graph of SNWD eigs shows that the fourth and fifth eigs are quite fluctuant.</td>
      <td><p style='color:green'>Better</p>Submission 1 is more informative and figures are well explained. The analysis of TOBS and PRCP in submission 2 is not very well performed.</td>

      <td><p style='color:red'>Worse</p>Submission 1 had a nice very nice analysis for all categories, but added cdf and geographical distribution analysis with plots for elevation vs. coefficients which fit nicely and supported her conclusions.</td>
      <td><p style='color:grey'>Equal Presentation</p>Both were thorough and convincing. I cannot choose here either.</td>
