      <td><p style='color:green'>Better</p>It is clear that Submission 2 involve with more analyzing tools than Submission 1. For example, Submission 2 uses hypothesis test to analyze the correlation between two fixed stations, with detailed results such as p-value histogram. However, Submission 1 had nothing related to this important part.</td>
      <td><p style='color:green'>Better</p>Submission 2 showed better originality. Several points can be noticed in Submission 2. For example, it involved with the geographical distribution of top 3 coefficients, while submission one just simply showed the map. Also, Submission 2 includes detailed hypothesis test analysis, while Submission 1 didn't. Actually, Submission 1 seems in the framework of the sample report.</td>
      <td><p style='color:green'>Better</p>Both reports showed reasonable significance. However, as mentioned before, Submission 2 implemented more analysis tools, thus, it results in more convincing results. One significant example is the conclusion in Submission 2, which claims "correlation of whether rain or not in some locations", resulting from the hypothesis test part.</td>
      <td><p style='color:green'>Better</p>In submission 1, I notice that it suddenly jumped to the PRCP analysis from the SNWD analysis, with fragmentary conclusion of the previous part. On the other hand, Submission 2 organized much better. from data check to Variance analysis, following with the PCA analysis and hypothesis test, respectively.</td>

      <td><p style='color:green'>Better</p>They both chose SNWD as main factor to analyze and received similar results of ~80% of variance being explained by the top 5 eigen-vectors. However, submission 2 went deeper and analyzed coefficients and variations of timing of snow, which makes the entire argument better supported.</td>
