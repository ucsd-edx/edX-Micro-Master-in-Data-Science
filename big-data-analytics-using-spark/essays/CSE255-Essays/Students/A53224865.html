      <td><p style='color:red'>Worse</p> They both used correct graph to support their conclusions. I found the claims about the geographical distribution of first 4 coefficient are not convincing enough. For one thing, I did not find explanations on what solid color/clear color triangles mean in this graph.</td>
      <td><p style='color:grey'>Equal Presentation</p>Both reports present the analysis in a clear and convincing way, except I did find some spelling errors in Submission 2. E.g. In residual 2 analysis, "residual1" was typed, and it did not convert F to C and show the values either in the graph or in the wording. However submission 1 decided to show percentage of variance per measurement with one figure per page, which makes it harder to compare one another.</td>
