Submission 2 looks almost the same as the example report, just with the dataset changed.",Submission 1,"Submission 1 analyzes topics with proper explanations (eg. what to analyze and why to analyze it, what each step means and takes, etc.)

However, Submission 2 simply copies the template from example report and does not discuss the statistical support in depth.",Submission 1,"Although neither submission goes much further beyond provided notebooks, submission 1 analyzes different aspects of the dataset and reasons why things happened or not happened (this thought process reflects originality to some extent). 

However, submission 2 does not show thorough reasoning and creative thoughts in the report - it simply copies the example report template.

I do not think that submission 1 demonstrates great originality, but compared to submission 2 it still wins.",Submission 1,"Submission 1 demonstrates good presentation with good visualizations and explanations. It is easy to follow the analysis flow.

However, submission 2 only finished minimum work since it does not change much from example report; also, some of the discussions are not convincing (eg. submission 2 states that heavy snow occurs in November, yet stats shows that despite of the snowfall peak, snow depth is only 0.4 inches max - it would be better to elaborate the conclusion more with statistics instead of just subjective descriptions)",149,41,SBBBSBSS,Equal Rigor,"Both submissions use proper statistical tools and follow the steps provided by instructors or steps of standard statistical tests. Also, for calculation part, both submissions reasoned mathematical theory behind.",Submission 1,"Although both submissions provide enough statistical support for each section in reports, submission 1 analyzes a more comprehensive range of dataset (i.e. more aspects being inspected) and demonstrates more useful/interesting data analysis. ",Equal Originality,"Although submission 1 covers more aspects of the dataset than submission 2, neither submission really goes beyond the provided notebooks. All ideas are from starter notebooks, just with data and inspected measurements changed.",Submission 1,"Submission 1 demonstrates analysis in more visualizable way via histograms, correlation matrix and google maps; while submission 2 does not have a variety of visualizations (partially because it does not have that much content compared to submission 1). Also, submission 2 does not provide visualization for analyzing correlation between precipitation across locations. ",65,9,SSSBBSSB,Equal Rigor,"Both submissions use proper statistical tools and follow the steps provided by instructors or standard statistical tests (eg. null hypothesis, alternative hypothesis).

",Equal Originality,"Both submissions comprehensively analyze different aspects of the dataset and have their own opinions/analysis on data behaviors, yet neither of them really went beyond the starter notebooks. Almost all original ideas are from provided notebooks, with only data and inspected measurements changed.",Submission 2,"submission 2 demonstrates a better presentation that figures/graphs are properly positioned and sized, while submission 1 does not pay too much attention on formatting, which makes some figures oversized and pushed down to another page. Also, submission 2 as a repot is more professional and is easier to follow (eg. it has summary and conclusion sections.)",110,109,BBBBSSBB,One or Two Missing Submission,two missing submissions,One or Two Missing Submission,two missing submissions,One or Two Missing Submission,two missing submissions,One or Two Missing Submission,two missing submissions

5/19/2017 23:56:00,Weike Ye,A53080809,150,176,BSSSBSBB,Submission 1,The submission 2 gave a PCA analysis on TOBS when clearly the top 3 eigen vectors can only explain 40% of the variance of TOBS. Submission1 is better in this regard since there is a good analyzing residues part which explains why PCA is not good for PRCP. Also submission 2 fails to show list of highly correlated states.,Submission 1,The submission 1 gave a comparison of highly correlated stations and not so correlated one. It's more convincing to see the correlation between p-value and spatial relationship.,Submission 1,"In the notebooks, submission 1 uses heatmap to show how correlated each measurements are to each other. ",Submission 1,The document layout of submission one is more clear. For example the RMS data was put in the one line in submission2. The titles in submission 1 is more logic and the conclusions were listed out which is nice.,34,129,BSBSSSBB,Submission 2,The both used the analysis and plots for the right purposes.,Submission 1,"Submission 2's data validation do not have figures for In analyzing spatial correlation , submission 2 is rather vague and data regarding p-value, such as the histogram and the matrix  are missing.",Submission 2,"Submission 1 follows the instruction closely and have very little changes. Submission 2 clearly went beyond the instruction. In part of Spatial vs Temporal patterns, the author found the reason of having a storm for an outlier data point, which is a good implement. ",Submission 2,"In terms of presentation, submission 2 is better. The data was organized, all plots are rightfully labeled and explained. Submission 1 provided more data, and general explanation were given. But the down sides are: sections are less organized figures are not properly labeled and units of data are not missing.",27,67,SSSSBBSS,Submission 2,"The correlation matrix in submission 1 seems to be wrong.
The last plot of map is supposed to plot most correlated stations not top ca components. 
But submission 2 has incorrect sanity check with no outside data to compare to and  imprecise interpretations of coefficients in PCA coefficients.",Submission 2,,Submission 2,"In submission 2,the map visualization tool were used in multiple ways for multiple purposes whereas submission 1 basically closely followed the instruction.",Submission 2,"Submission 2 is more organized and morelogical sections, and properly labeled figures. However, there are too may subplots/data in one figure, making it almost unreadable. Submission 1 , on the other hand ,has less logical organization. The fonts of the section titles are inconsistent. And data should presented in the same section was separated. And figures are not properly labeled.",98,106,SBBSSBSS,Submission 2,They basically used statistical tools for the right purposes. Submission 1 is not complete. Submission 2 is very thorough and the interpretation and usage of the statistical tools are correct.,Submission 2,"Submission 1 does not have a proper sanity check of data with no external data presented, and it does not show negative coefficients reconstruction plots. Also submission 1 does not have spatial and temporal variation analysis.",Submission 2,The submission 1 is not complete. Submission 2 organized the data in from different notebooks in a more logical ways.,Submission 2,"The submission 2 is very organized, subtitles and conclusions are listed clear and logical. ",139,151,BBSBSBSB,Submission 1,The temperature and precipitation data in submission 2 was not converted to right units thus hard to compare with external data.And the Percentage o variance of TMIN is wrong in submission 2.,Submission 1,Submission 2 in the examples of reconstructions the coefficients values are not given thus hard to support the conclusions.And there is no p-value or correlation data showing the temporal and spatial correlations.,Submission 1,"Submission 1 gives latitude span and longitude span to lock the location of the destination which is smart.
Submission 2 is not even complete.",Submission 1,"As presented before the submission 2 is not complete, figures was does not have axes labels and data was not in right units. Submission 1 is much better in the mentioned fields, but the author can have better presentation by reorganizing data in more meaningful section titles. "
