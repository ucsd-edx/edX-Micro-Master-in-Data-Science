I think the answer in the `good` directory and the `long-but-not-convincing` directory may worth your attention.

* good: The answer is very interesting.
* long-but-not-convincing: The student put much effort.
* little-analysis: Little analysis to support the claim, most commonly simple value counts for each day.
* just-guess: Claims without any analysis to the data.
