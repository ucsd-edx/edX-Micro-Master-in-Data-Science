The explanation you give for the end of the month dips is good, and you wrote some relevant code to identify these stations. However, you did not show that, after removing the identified stations, the phenomenon is removed.

You provide some reasonable explanations:
location at a special place where workers are lazy or do no want to go to work at the end of the month.
Years when the american economy is not well.
However, your analysis is unrelated to these explanations. One thing you could have done regarding explanation one was to find out whether a few stations are responsible for the pattern or whether it is distributed throughout the stations. You could also see if the behaviour is the same for different ranges of years.

Very nice work!
You have dug deep into the data, made observations, and supported them with the figures.
To get the notebook to be of higher quality, think of how to organize the markdown cells, the code cells, and the figures. It is usually better to organize the notebook logically: Question, Answer, Support for answer, follow-up questions, rather than chronologically: I did this, then I did that ...

You provided no explanations, but rather jumped directly to solutions. Obviously, removing stations with missing entries will solve the problem, but it might also introduce bias. By characterizing the problem more accurately, you can reduce this bias.

The problem might be the poor english. But part of writing an explanation is checking it with other students to make sure that the explanation is clear and can be understood.
A method is described to remove the count dips over the end of the month. I guess that the graph titled ""TMAX Sample Stations Counts"" should be better than than the one titled ""TMAX All Station Counts"", but I don't see a significant improvement.

Instructor Feedback to extra credit
The explanation given in the first bullet is not supported by evidence. The method for removing the effect is very crude - your are removing any station-year that does not have a full set of measurements. Nothing related to end-of-month specifically. and removes 56% of the data.
It is not clear to me what the figures below are meant to represent or explain.

It seems you are not very comfortable with the notebook format. In particular, with writing markdown cells with explanations in english. The code is here in service of the explanation, not the other way around.
Having explanations as comments in the code and printing out large tables does not help.
