                <h3>Login and Sign Up</h3>
                <p>
                    Students enrolled or waitlisted in the course can sign-up using their PID and official UCSD e-mail id(@ucsd.edu and not @{dept}.ucsd.edu). You may choose a password of your choice while signing up.
                    <br>
                    <br> You PID and password will be the credentials that will be used for logging in to your account at all further times. If you forget your password, you will have to send a mail to the TA to have your password reset.
                </p>
                <h3>Dashboard</h3>
                <p>
                    Your dashboard will provide access to the Spark cluster. You can send you jobs to the cluster and view the output and the logs. There are three tabs with will you can use different functionalities to work with your homework.
                </p>
                <h3>Playground</h3>
                <p>
                    This is a place for you to play with your pyspark programs. To submit your jobs to the cluster, select the file from your local machine and upload it. Please note that only python files will be accepted for upload and your file should contain the header displayed on the website for it execute properly on the cluster.
                    <br>
                    <br> Your pending and completed jobs will be shown in "My Submissions" table. You will have to refresh the table to update the status of your jobs in the table. Your code, stderr and stdout generated by your program can be viewed after it completes execution. You will be able to make only one job submission at a time i.e. you can have no more than one pending job in the queue. The following table shows the description of various status messages:
                </p>
                <table id="jobs" class="table table-sm table-bordered text-center">
                    <thead>
                        <tr>

                        </tr>

                            <td>compiling</td>
                                    <td>Your code is being compiled</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>compile error</td>
                                    <td>Compile error. Check stdout for more information</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>running</td>
                                    <td>The job is running on spark cluster</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>time limit exceeded</td>
                                    <td>Your code exceeds the maximum time limit</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>completed</td>
                                    <td>Program finished, but the output may not be correct</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>runtime error</td>

                        <tr>

                                    <td>Program finished, but it didn't launch on Spark. It ran locally. Mostly something is wrong with the creation of SparkContext</td>
                        </tr>
                    </tbody>
                </table>
                <h3>View all pending/running jobs</h3>
                <p>
                    Here, you can view all the jobs form all users that are currently present in the server's queue or are being executed by the server. You will not be able to view the code or stdout or stderr of the jobs here. This feature is basically to give you an idea of where your job stands in the queue so that you have an estimate the amount of time it will take before your job runs on the server. You will have to refresh the table to update its status.
                </p>
                <h3>Submit Final Homework</h3>
                <p>
                    The final pyspark program that you want us to evaluate for the homework should be submitted here. Please note that final submission is different from the playground. Playground is provided to allow you to run/debug your programs on the cluster. We will strictly not consider any program submitted on the playground as a final submission. You will have to submit your final program in the "Submit Final Homework" section of the webpage.
                    <br>
                    <br> Submissions will remain open till the homework deadline. You can re-submit your final submission any number of times before the deadline. Only your last submission will be considered for evaluation. We keep a track of only the last submission so we won't cater to any request for considering a previous submission as the final submission.
