In order to amend the workflow:

* Go to https://www.draw.io/
* Import the xml file in this directory to the editor (using "open existing diagram").
* Make the changes in editor
* Download the changed xml and the JPEG files (created using export)
* Upload both to this directory (replace the existing files)
* Make sure the updated workflow is visible here: https://github.com/ucsd-edx/edX-Micro-Master-in-Data-Science/wiki/Workflow-of-Tasks-for-CSE-255-and-DSE-230
