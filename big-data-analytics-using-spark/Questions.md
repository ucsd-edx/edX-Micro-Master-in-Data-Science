### Directions for how to write problems

The course is divided into 5 sections of two weeks

Each section is divided into 4 classes

For each video in the class write 3 multiple choice questions that test comprehension of the video.

For each class write 10 questions, both multiple choice or checklist or numeric.

These problems should be entered directly into edX studio.


In addition, for CSE255 and DSE230 write 4 question quizes to be administered during class. As there are two section, we need two version of the quizes, at most 2 questions in common.

There qre existing quizes in the directory "quizes", please put your new quizes there.
