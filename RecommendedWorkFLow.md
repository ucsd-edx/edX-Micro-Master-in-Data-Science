1) Generate a notebook that has the full information of the class, all
of the code, the exercises and the tests.

2) For the slides: skip the TLDR and use only cells that are critical
to the didactic path.  Then use the command

edX-Micro-Master-in-Data-Science/big-data-analytics-using-spark/notebooks/BasicSpark/Reveal/toSlides.py
<notebookname>.ipynb

To be done: use decktape to translate Reveal slides to pdf slides.

Import the pdf slides into powerpoint and add animation slides and such.

3) For the HW: create tests and include for each assert a meaningful
messages. Create the tests in an external file that is imported and
run. This way the tests on the nbgrader server can be more elaborate.
